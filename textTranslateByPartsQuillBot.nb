architecture cannot accomplish high security, high availability, high \
abstraction, and high performance all at once. All that software architects \
need to do is know, understand, and relate one real narrative to their peers \
and clients. I am speaking of Vaza's history.\n\nIn 1620, there was a war \
between Sweden and Poland. An attempt was made to bring this expensive war to \
an early end by the Swedish King by ordering the construction of a galleon \
known as the vase. The ship was not like the others. It was unlike any other \
ship of the time in its features. It had to be longer than sixty meters in \
order to safely convey 300 men at a time to Poland while also carrying 64 \
weapons on two battery decks. Time was running out, and there wasn't enough \
money\[LongDash]sounds familiar? The shipyard has never before designed such \
ships. Smaller, single-decker boats were his specialty. Still, he used his \
prior experience and abilities to develop and construct the Vaza. As a \
result, a ship was built to meet these specifications. The weather is going \
to fall today. The ship proudly entered the harbor and saluted with all of \
her cannons. Then he succumbed.\n\nThe Vaza problem was obvious to everyone \
who had seen the deck of a huge 17th-century battleship: these ships' decks \
were dangerously crowded, especially during battle. Creating ships that could \
be used for both combat and transportation was an expensive mistake. To cater \
to the king's every want, the shipwright built an unsteady and unbalanced \
ship.\n\nA software architect may take this dismal experience into \
consideration and learn a lot from this story while designing the \
architecture of a software product. An unstable architecture is created when \
wants are tried to be satisfied all at once (like with the Vaza), making it \
impossible to accurately finish any of the jobs. A good example of this is \
forcing service-oriented architecture (SOA) to function in parallel as a \
point-to-point solution. This usually means that we have to steer clear of \
the numerous levels of abstraction generated by the SOA technique, and the \
result is an architecture that resembles spaghetti at a restaurant in Italy. \
An architect can use a range of methods to determine the necessary sacrifices \
when building architecture. Two popular methods of this kind are the \
Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) and the Cost Benefit Analysis \
Method (CBAM)."],

Sooner or later, every programmer has to perform refactoring of existing \
code. But before diving in, consider a few things that can save you and your \
colleagues a lot of time (and spare you from headaches):\n\n- It is best to \
start refactoring by assessing the state of the existing code in the project \
and the tests written for it. This way, you can identify the strengths and \
weaknesses of the code in its current state, to preserve its strong points \
and avoid the mistakes already made. Everyone thinks their system will be \
better than the current one... until it turns out that the new code is no \
better, and maybe even worse, than the previous version, all because we did \
not learn from the mistakes made in the old system.\n\n- Resist the urge to \
rewrite everything from scratch. It is best to reuse as much code as \
possible. No matter how ugly it may seem, this code has already been tested, \
reviewed, and so on. Throwing away old code, especially if it has been used \
in a production system, means discarding months (or years) of work on tested \
and battle-hardened code that may contain unknown workarounds or bug fixes. \
If you don't take this into account, the new code may exhibit the same \
mysterious bugs that have already been fixed in the old code. As a result, \
you will waste a lot of time and effort, as well as the knowledge accumulated \
over the years.\n\n- A multitude of small changes is better than one large \
one. By making small changes, it is easier to assess their impact on the \
system using standard feedback channels, such as testing. It's disheartening \
to see a good hundred unit tests \"fail\" after a change is made. The \
irritation and anxiety caused by such results can lead you to make \
questionable decisions. It's much easier to cope if only one or two tests \
\"fail\" at any given moment.\n\n- After each development iteration, it is \
important to ensure that all existing tests pass successfully. If the \
existing tests do not cover the changes you made, create new tests. Do not \
thoughtlessly discard tests from old code. It may seem at first glance that \
some of them are not applicable to the new system architecture, but it is \
definitely worth taking the time to understand the purpose of each specific \
test.\n\n- Leave personal preferences and ego aside. Why fix something that \
already works? If the style or organization of the code contradicts your \
tastes, it is not a sufficient reason for refactoring. Just as your \
confidence that you can write better code than the previous programmer.\n\n- \
The emergence of new technology is not a compelling enough reason to conduct \
refactoring. It is very bad when refactoring is undertaken solely because the \
existing code is years behind the latest cutting-edge technologies, and we \
think that a new language or platform will allow us to solve the problem much \

Conducting code reviews is necessary. Why? It improves code quality and \
reduces the relative share of defects. But you may be misunderstanding why \
this happens.\n\nMany programmers have an aversion to code reviews, which can \
be linked to their unfortunate personal experiences. I have encountered \
organizations where all code underwent formal review before it could enter \
the system for commercial use. Often, the review is conducted by an architect \
or lead developer\[LongDash]a practice that can be called \"the architect \
checks everything.\" This is documented in the company's software development \
process guide, and programmers are required to comply.\n\nPerhaps, in some \
organizations, such a strict and formal process is indeed necessary, but they \
are in the minority. In most organizations, such an approach is \
counterproductive. The authors of the code under review seem to be appearing \
before a parole board. Reviewers need to keep up with reading the code and \
tracking all the nuances of the evolving system: they can quickly become the \
bottleneck of the entire process, causing it to degrade soon.\n\nCode review \
should not just be a method for fixing errors in the code, but a means of \
spreading knowledge and establishing common coding standards. By allowing \
other programmers to familiarize themselves with your code, you make each of \
them a co-owner of the code. Let any team member walk through the code with \
the others. There is no need to look for errors; during code review, you \
should strive to study it and understand how it works.\n\nDuring code \
reviews, be kind. Comments should be constructive, not sharp. Assign roles \
for the review process to ensure that seniority does not influence the code \
evaluation. For example, one reviewer can focus on documentation, another on \
exceptions, and a third on functionality. This approach will distribute the \
review workload more evenly among team members.\n\nAgree on a specific day of \
the week to be a regular code review day. Allocate a couple of hours for this \
activity. Rotate the author of the code being reviewed each time. \
Additionally, don't forget to change the roles of the participants in the \
review at each meeting. Involve newcomers in the review process. Despite \
their limited experience, they can provide you with a fresh perspective \
thanks to their recent university knowledge. Engage experts \[Dash] they \
possess experience and knowledge. They will quickly and accurately point out \
code that is prone to errors. Code reviews will be easier if the team's \
coding standards are checked by an automated tool. In this case, you will \
never have to discuss code formatting at the review meeting.\n\nPerhaps the \
main measure of the success of a review is whether it is interesting to \
people. Reviews are oriented towards the people involved. If a review meeting \
takes place in an unpleasant or boring atmosphere, it will be difficult to \
motivate anyone. Conduct code reviews in an informal setting, and let the \
main goal of the event be the dissemination of knowledge among team members. \

really want to learn a new technology, practice is necessary: write some \
code.\\n\\n- Try to work with a mentor, because if you are the most advanced \
specialist in the company, it may hinder your education. Of course, you can \
learn something from anyone, but you will learn much more from a more \

consider moving to another job.\\n\\n- Use virtual mentors. Look for authors \

apply it more effectively. If these are open-source tools, you are in luck. \

to others or talk about it. If you have to speak in front of others and \

speaking in front of a specialized user group or at a local \
conference.\\n\\n- Join a study group for a particular technology (like a \
community for discussing design pattern applications \[Dash] patterns \
community) or organize such a group yourself. It could be a study group for a \

mind throughout the process. Attempting to refactor \"in one go\" can cause \
so many problems that doubts may arise about the feasibility of the overhaul \
altogether.\n\nBecome a surgeon, boldly removing affected tissues in the name \
of healing. Such an approach is contagious and will inspire your colleagues \
to carry out the long-overdue cleanup in other projects. Keep a list of \
\"hygienic\" tasks that, in the team's opinion, would benefit the project. \
Convince the management that, despite the lack of visible results, such work \
reduces costs and speeds up the release of new versions. Constantly show \
concern for the overall \"health\" of the code."],

000Z.jpg'\\n+++\\nI would want to share some insights from my recent return \
to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening \
in large organizations.\\n\\n## Examining\\n\\nTech-screening then takes off \
like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of \
questions during the first call. As an example:\\n\\n-How is it possible to \
halt the container?\\nThe original data types in Python?\\nWhat is the PID of \
the Linux kernel?\\nHow are PACELC and CAP understood?\\n- -...\\n\\n\\n Some \
even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire \
platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. \\\"How do I send a message to \
the generator?\\\" Or even \\\"What does this code do?\\\" He knows that the \
code is so strange that I wouldn't just ignore it in a review. Yes, I did \
notice that the reason we get a negative is because the second argument in \
sorted is merely named. I confirmed that the system doesn't care what Google \
completes in twenty-five seconds.\\n\\nDo you intend to host screenings of \
this nature? On the Skytrain, I heard one such unusual conversation. But even \
recruiters seem tired of outsiders applying for every available job without \
any prior knowledge of the company.\\n\\nBut roughly 20 percent of them had \
realized the power of the calendar at the same time. For whatever reason, \
they think the conversation ends when someone says, \\\"I made a call on \
Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the link...\\\" No, go away! Schedule! Given that I\
\\n\\n-I'll pick a time slot; I'll be forgetful; I'll break links; and I'll \
count for sixty minutes instead of sixty.\\nI don't get to know the other \
person right away.\\n- and it was typically at 1:30 pm UTC (not \
PST).\\n\\nThere needs to be a prerequisite exam for hiring a recruiter. \\\" \
Oh, \\\"Oh, free all day\\\" (and quiet, too...). Moreover, if you request a \
move because of illness, you will not be remembered at all. With the \
calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.\\n\\n## Real-Time \
Coding\\n\\nThere's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people enjoy \
the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), and \
one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following the \
interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, code-filled \
profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident from this that \
the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure that all \
candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. At the \
second, he'll ask himself, \\\"Do I really need this?\\\" It expires since \
there are currently three offers.\\n\\nYou usually have two tasks to finish. \
Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go \
back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated \
hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this \
hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help \
rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be \
disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \
of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) \\\"Because you \
probably have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\\\" Wonderful \
~{fail~~win!\\n\\nWith one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding \
experience I've ever had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me \
writing the more complex second and him writing the first. That's when I \
realized there was another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. \
We have a co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working \
at \\\"Big4\\\" doesn't always involve this.\\n\\nIt is also expected of \
students to work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount \
of additional RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so \
much, but it still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing \
and maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization \
problems with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview \
turns into an Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you \
ought to have thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck \
at all.\\n\\nThe interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason \
behind people's distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a \
laptop with a scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most \
popular; syntax illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with \
a task to find another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had \
were the white screen and the message \\\"Transfer money from account A to \
account B.\\\" Not even an interface, not even a template, not even a \
proposal for the BD... For ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they \
want to see. Consider taking writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all \
of this support code isn't very task-related.\\n\\nWhat steps do we need to \
take right now? What piqued my curiosity the most was the subject of the PR \
talk. Here, one can tell how someone will behave in a professional context \
straight away without having to use irony. What he is paying attention to, \
what he ignores, and why. For example, since formatting is the responsibility \
of linters, gentlemen typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more \
on APIs, races, and working optimally with the base. I really advise trying \
it out.\\n\\n## Architecture of the System\\n\\nSystem design interviews are \
another type of interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to \
create a system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out \
the architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, \
DFD, and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. \
Gathering requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and \
determining use cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most \
crucial things are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning \
face. They'll be behind you in forty minutes.\\n\\n## Knowledge assessment\\n\
\\nSo, I went over the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I \
exaggerated. No, though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, \
Python testing, and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the \
offer. Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only \
does it work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just \
coding, but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward \
and outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send \
soaps there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of \
course, but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks \
superficially in addition to not looking at all.\\n\\nTake the problem of \
figuring out the program's runtime, for example. Well, \\\"time.\\\" is \
challenging. I would have brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, \
the appropriate solution is to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but \
will we really take measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? \
seems time that seems boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring \
more, I learned that while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, \
they have no understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.\\n\\nIn \
addition, the NAC interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the \
individuals I will be working with. Then someone said, \\\"I have a few \
questions for you.\\\" For some reason, I thought we were incompatible \
immediately.\\n\\n## SRE/DevOps\\n\\nGiven that I had a lot of free time and \
was unemployed, I chose to interview with DevOps. Was it all for nothing\
\[LongDash]joking, snarky, still passed, but embarrassing to write about\
\[LongDash]the Linux course on Udemy? That's when I really started to like \
the process. The two processes in question were troubleshooting and general \
knowledge.\\n\\nThe interviewer mainly stuck to the list of questions, but he \
was also allowed to veer off topic from time to time, which enlivened the \
conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, databases, \
and functioning in containers. What is a universal phenomenon that exists in \
all forms throughout the universe? They might not have been so deeply, but a \
baccalaureate could have addressed them. In the end, the other person learned \
something new, and I gave them some resources to look into.\\n\\nIt was a \
troubleshooting role-playing game. Users report that even with a system in \
place, the website does not load. There are no notebooks or dashboards; \
instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be programmed to do or observe \
things. At least it was fun and as near to the real job as it gets. It's not \
a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. And in this instance, the \
scientific method is subordinated to actual observations. The system's \
condition at the time of the incident must be partially known to the \
SRE.\\n\\n## Advice for prospective candidates\\n\\nOver the last five years, \
I've conducted several hundred interviews with both sides. A few life tips \
are as follows:\\n\\nYou are going to have to go through the windshields. You \
won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you apply your skills, either \
something exciting arises out of the blue or it will be the only place with \
the offer. You never know what might be found within a candy box.\\n\\n -Get \
some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The same live code is kind of dumb; \
the response will appear immediately even if it doesn't appear during the \
request.\\nFill up a glass with water. When faced with any unclear situation, \
drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\\nTalk to me. It's a good \
idea to talk about distracting topics with your coworker or cat prior to the \
conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\\nStay at ease. It may be \
more challenging, for sure, but after a year or two, you'll even say, \
\\\"Thank you.\\\" This way of thinking will help to reduce the degree of \
stiffness to some extent.\\nMake sure to solicit feedback from others. \
Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\\n\\n\\nI would want to \
remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you \
weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't \
make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along \
with the statements, \\\"We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the \
penny against Quater,\\\" and that I was \\\"overqualified.\\\" Perhaps there \
isn't a position available for me.\\n\\n## Interviewers' \
suggestions\\n\\nMore empathy. Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove \
him; your role is to assess whether communication is comfortable between you \
both and whether he can fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not \
possible to complete it in one and a half hours.\\n\\n## Lack of \
conviction\\n\\n Most of them were start-ups or small enterprises with 20\
\[Dash]30 employees. Consequently, a discernible distinction exists between \
their interviews and the ones conducted by the corporation. Recruiters \

Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you ought to have \
thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck at all.\n\n\
The interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason behind people's \
distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a laptop with a \
scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most popular; syntax \
illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with a task to find \
another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had were the white \
screen and the message \"Transfer money from account A to account B.\" Not \
even an interface, not even a template, not even a proposal for the BD... For \
ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they want to see. Consider taking \
writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all of this support code isn't \
very task-related.\n\nWhat steps do we need to take right now? What piqued my \
curiosity the most was the subject of the PR talk. Here, one can tell how \
someone will behave in a professional context straight away without having to \
use irony. What he is paying attention to, what he ignores, and why. For \
example, since formatting is the responsibility of linters, gentlemen \
typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more on APIs, races, and \
working optimally with the base. I really advise trying it out.\n\n## \
Architecture of the System\n\nSystem design interviews are another type of \
interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to create a \
system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out the \
architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, \
and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. Gathering \
requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and determining use \
cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most crucial things \
are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning face. They'll \
be behind you in forty minutes.\n\n## Knowledge assessment\n\nSo, I went over \
the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I exaggerated. No, \
though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, Python testing, \
and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the offer. \
Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only does it \
work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just coding, \
but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward and \
outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send soaps \
there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of course, \
but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks superficially in \
addition to not looking at all.\n\nTake the problem of figuring out the \
program's runtime, for example. Well, \"time.\" is challenging. I would have \
brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, the appropriate solution is \
to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but will we really take \
measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? seems time that seems \
boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring more, I learned that \
while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, they have no \
understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.\n\nIn addition, the NAC \
interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the individuals I will \
be working with. Then someone said, \"I have a few questions for you.\" For \
some reason, I thought we were incompatible immediately.\n\n## SRE/DevOps\n\n\
Given that I had a lot of free time and was unemployed, I chose to interview \
with DevOps. Was it all for nothing\[LongDash]joking, snarky, still passed, \
but embarrassing to write about\[LongDash]the Linux course on Udemy? That's \
when I really started to like the process. The two processes in question were \
troubleshooting and general knowledge.\n\nThe interviewer mainly stuck to the \
list of questions, but he was also allowed to veer off topic from time to \
time, which enlivened the conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux \
loading, networking, databases, and functioning in containers. What is a \
universal phenomenon that exists in all forms throughout the universe? They \
might not have been so deeply, but a baccalaureate could have addressed them. \
In the end, the other person learned something new, and I gave them some \
resources to look into.\n\nIt was a troubleshooting role-playing game. Users \
report that even with a system in place, the website does not load. There are \
no notebooks or dashboards; instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be \
programmed to do or observe things. At least it was fun and as near to the \
real job as it gets. It's not a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. \
And in this instance, the scientific method is subordinated to actual \
observations. The system's condition at the time of the incident must be \
partially known to the SRE.\n\n## Advice for prospective candidates\n\nOver \
the last five years, I've conducted several hundred interviews with both \
sides. A few life tips are as follows:\n\nYou are going to have to go through \
the windshields. You won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you \
apply your skills, either something exciting arises out of the blue or it \
will be the only place with the offer. You never know what might be found \
within a candy box.\n\n -Get some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The \
same live code is kind of dumb; the response will appear immediately even if \
it doesn't appear during the request.\nFill up a glass with water. When faced \
with any unclear situation, drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\n\
Talk to me. It's a good idea to talk about distracting topics with your \
coworker or cat prior to the conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\
\nStay at ease. It may be more challenging, for sure, but after a year or \
two, you'll even say, \"Thank you.\" This way of thinking will help to reduce \
the degree of stiffness to some extent.\nMake sure to solicit feedback from \
others. Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\n\n\nI would want to \
remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you \
weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't \
make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along \
with the statements, \"We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the \
penny against Quater,\" and that I was \"overqualified.\" Perhaps there isn't \
a position available for me.\n\n## Interviewers' suggestions\n\nMore empathy. \
Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove him; your role is to assess \
whether communication is comfortable between you both and whether he can \
fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not possible to complete it \
in one and a half hours.\n\n## Lack of conviction\n\n Most of them were \
start-ups or small enterprises with 20\[Dash]30 employees. Consequently, a \
discernible distinction exists between their interviews and the ones \
conducted by the corporation. Recruiters receive a lot of resumes and job \
openings, so at first, bold decisions could appear possible. For example, \
following seven fruitful interviews, I received word that I could not be \
recruited. How absurd is that? But I can use their hiring for streaming as a \
justification. Everyone is being seriously taken advantage of by them, \"and \
we're going to figure it out someday.\" Additionally, all of the procedures \
are fully standardized. Whether you're a senior Python student with fifteen \
years of referral experience or not, you go through every step of misery."],

debatable. However, it is a direct consequence of the fact that programming \
and software development, in general, require continuous knowledge expansion. \
As you work on a project, you will come to better understand the subject area \
and, hopefully, find more efficient ways to achieve your goals. To avoid \
doing unnecessary work, it is essential to take the time to study the results \
of what you are doing, reflect on what you see, and adjust your behavior \
accordingly."],
