communication. No one in your group will read a 100-page document justifying \
your architectural decisions.The ability to express your thoughts clearly and \
clearly is vital to the success of any program project.From the very \
beginning of work on the project adhere to simple explanations and in no case \
start making long descriptions in Word.Use tools like Visio to create simple \
charts that explain your ideas.Diagrams should be simple, because they will \
almost change frequently.Informal meetings are another effective means of \
disseminating information.The best way to communicate your thoughts to the \
project participants is to bring together a group of developers (or other \
architects) in one room and display your ideas on the board.Be sure to take a \
digital camera with you (nothing is more annoying than the requirement to \
release the conference room when you have just finished drawing). After the \
meeting, take a picture, multiply it and distribute to the rest of the \
participants via wiki.Postpone the creation of spacious documents and focus \
on bringing your ideas to colleagues, and then you can think of a more \
detailed presentation of your architectural solutions.\\n\\nMost software \
architects do not realize that they must also be leaders. To work in a \
healthy and productive environment, you as a leader must win the respect of \
your colleagues. Keeping developers unaware of what the overall picture looks \
like and why certain decisions are made is the right path to disaster. On the \
contrary, by attracting the developers to your side, you create a collective \
working environment in which the correctness of your architectural decisions \
is checked. In turn, connecting designers to the architecture creation \
process ensures their commitment and interest.\\n\\nKeep in mind that clarity \
and leadership are important for interacting with all team members (not only \
with developers, but also with the testing team, business analysts and \
project managers). Clear communication and effective leadership enhance the \
quality of communication and create a strong and healthy working environment.\

have all fallen into \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]budget\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
refinements, when smart technological solutions are \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]buried\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for savings.The \
conversation goes like this:\n\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do we really need X?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the project sponsor asks.\n\nIn place of X you can \
replace virtually everything vital to the system: software licenses, surplus \
servers, external backups or power sources. The question is always asked in a \
native tone, as if you are dropping all your pocket money on comics and \
chewing, while serious adults need to think about buying new shells, in which \
they will drag their future profits.\n\nThe correct answer to this question \
is, \"Yes. Absolutely necessary.\" But for some reason, almost no one \
answers.\n\nAfter all, we have technical education, and any technical \
discipline is the art of compromise.It is clear that no one will need exotic \
power sources if you put several white wheels in the data center and start \
interns in them.And instead of saying, \"Yes, absolutely necessary,\" we say \
something true: \"You can actually do without a second server, if you're \
willing to play with the gaps because of prevention and with each memory \
failure.Although if we buy a memory with automatic regularity control, then \
this problem can be bypassed.So there are only failures of the operating \
system on average every 3.9 days, which means that at night the server will \
have to restart, but it is quite able to do the trainees when tired of \
turning the wheels\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. \n\nAnd all this may be quite \
right, but you should not say that in any case. The sponsor stops listening \
to you after the words \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]really\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. \
\n\nThe problem is that you look at it from a technical point of view, and \
your sponsor clearly understands that he is negotiating. You're working \
together to find a solution, while he's conducting a \"go out/do not go out\" \
tactical manoeuvre. And in any negotiation, you should never make concessions \
on the first requirement. The correct answer to the question \"Do we really \
need X?\" is like this:\n\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Without a second server, \
the entire system will \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fall\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
about three times a day, especially during periods of maximum load and when \
demonstrated at board meetings. In fact, we need four servers to ensure that \
one independent pairins 100% performance, even if the other pair suddenly \
stops working.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\n\nOf course, you know perfectly well \
that the third and fourth servers are not really needed. This is a tactical \
gambit that will force your sponsor to switch the conversation to a different \
topic. You raise the bet and show that the system is still working on a \
minimal, risky configuration. Besides, if you miraculously manage to get \
additional servers, you can always pass one for testing (so that the testing \
environment is fully compatible with the working environment), and the other \
will be a great assembly machine."],

interfaces, allocating responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing \

other aspects, including safety, ease of use, easy maintenance, output \
management, choice of deployment settings, etc.However, all of these \

the architect. It can be said that the creation of architecture is the \
process of balancing priorities in the short-term and long-term perspectives \

is a time-consuming and expensive task.If no one is concerned about the \
performance of the system (neither the characteristics nor the meaning of the \

it falls below this threshold.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]But this can be called \

this is not the case.The presence of an alternative is a sign that \
uncertainty in the design of the system needs to be analysed. Use uncertainty \
as a determining factor to identify places where you can postpone the \
transition to details or apply breakdown and abstraction to reduce the \
importance of design decisions.If you strictly \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sew\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in the system the first decision that came to your \
mind, it is likely to tie your hands in the future.As a result, random \
decisions will begin to play an important role, and the flexibility of the \
software product will decrease.\n\n\n\nOne of the simplest and most \
constructive definitions of architecture was given by Grady Booch: \"Any \
architecture is the result of design, but not every design is aimed at \
creating architecture.Architecture serves as a representation of the \
important design solutions that shape the system, and the importance here is \
determined by the cost of changes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]It follows that an \
architecture that generally reduces the importance of design decisions is \
effective.Inefficient architecture increases this importance.If a design \
solution can lead one of the two paths, the architect must step back.Instead \
of choosing between options A and B, he needs to think about another \
question: \"How do I design a solution to reduce the importance of a choice \
between options \"A\" and \"B\"?In this situation, it is not the choice \
between A and B that is interesting, but the very fact that this choice \
exists (as well as the fact that the right choice is not necessarily obvious \
or unchanged). \n\n\n\nSometimes an architect has to walk around before he is \
illuminated and recognises a dichotomy. Are you standing at the board, \
discussing (very energetically) different options with a colleague?Are you \
deliberately throwing \"M-m-m\" and \"E-e-e\" over the code, endlessly \
scrambling possible implementations?When a new requirement or clarification \
of an existing requirement calls into question the reasonableness of the \
current implementation, you face uncertainty.How do we react to it?Think of \
how to isolate a decision from the code that ultimately depends on that \
decision by means of separation or encapsulation.The alternative to this is \
often the vague code, which, like a nervous person at an interview, cries \
something unreasonable and tries to compensate for the uncertainty with a lot \
of guesses and common phrases. And if the choice is made with firm, but \
unfounded confidence, the project at full speed and without a glance turns \
into the wrong path.\n\n\n\nOften there is a temptation to take a \"decision \
for a decision\".If there is uncertainty about the different paths to develop \
the system, decide not to make a decision. Postpone a particular decision \
until it can be taken more responsibly on the basis of real knowledge, but \
not for too long, so as not to get into a situation where that knowledge is \
already useless.\n\n\n\nArchitecture and the design process are closely \
intertwined; this is the main reason why the architect should give preference \
to such design cycles and architectural approaches that are empirical in \
nature and provide feedback in order to constructively use uncertainty to \
divide the system itself into parts and schedule its design."],

responsible for the quality of the product and its timely delivery.These \
challenges are difficult to solve without personal authority, which plays an \
extremely important role in the success of any project.\n\n\n\nThe best way \
to learn is to observe others; that's how we learn in childhood.A good \
architect should be able to identify a problem, put together a team and, \
without looking for the culprits, explain the essence of the problem, and \
then propose an elegant solution or a way around.At the same time, the \
architect can ask the team for help without losing any authority.Developers \
should feel their contribution to the problem, but the architect guides the \
discussion and determines the right approach.\n\n\n\nArchitects should join \
the team at the very earliest stages of the project; they should not sit in \
an ivory tower, pointing the way forward from there, but work \"in the \
field\" with everyone else.The issues of choosing a strategic direction or \
technology should not be transformed into independent research or new \
projects \[Dash] they should be approached pragmatically, searching for \
answers in the course of practical work or seeking advice from \
colleagues-architects (all good architects know each other).\n\n\n\nA good \
architect must have at the expert level at least one of the tools of his \
profession, such as an integrated design environment (IDE); remember that the \
architect should be a practitioner.It is logical that the software architect \
should know the IDE, the database architect \[Dash] the toolkit for building \
substance-relation charts (ER-charts), and the information architect - the \
XML modeling tools.However, the lead architect must be able to apply tools at \
all levels, from monitoring network traffic using Wireshark to simulating \
complex financial messages in XMLSpy \[Dash] there are no levels too low or \
too high for him.\n\n\n\nAs a rule, an architect comes up with a good summary \
and an impressive past.This is usually easy to impress the management and \
technical staff, but without demonstrating his skills in practice he is \
unlikely to be able to win the respect of the team.In such a situation, the \
team will experience training difficulties and its members are unlikely to be \
able to cope with the task for which they were hired."],

fundamental common solution: simplicity as a result of practical experience, \
rather than universality based on conjecture.\n\n\n\nThe priority of \
simplicity over versatility helps to make a choice between two architectural \
alternatives, equal in other respects.When two solutions are possible, prefer \
a simpler and more needs-oriented one rather than a more sophisticated and \
versatile one. Of course, it is quite possible (and not so rarely) that a \
simpler solution in practice will be more versatile.But, even if that doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t happen, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easier to change a simple \
solution when you have a good idea of what you need, than to adapt a \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]universal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] solution, which has \
proved to be not universal enough.\n\n\n\nDespite the architect's good \
intentions, many solutions designed for universal application end up \
inadequate for anything specific.Software components must first be designed \
for a specific task, and they must cope well with that task.Effective \
universality is born of understanding, and understanding leads to \
simplification.\n\n\n\nGeneralization sometimes allows to bring the problem \
to a more fundamental look; the created solution embodies the patterns of \
several well-known examples \[Dash] clear, compact and well-founded.However, \
excessive generalization itself turns into a challenge that leads in the \
opposite direction and increases complexity instead of reducing it.The desire \
for abstract generalization often leads to solutions that are not tied to the \
realities of actual development.Such generalizations are based on assumptions \
that later turn out to be false, suggest options that later become unwanted, \
and create a ballast that is then difficult or impossible to remove.In the \
end, this only increases the secondary complexity that future developers and \
architects will face.\n\n\n\nMany architects value universality, but this \
attitude should not be unconditional.As a rule, people are unwilling to pay \
for universal fattening (or do not need it): they are usually faced with a \
very specific challenge, and they value a specific solution to that \
challenge.Versatility and flexibility can appear in the creation of concrete \
solutions, but if at the same time we get off the anchor too quickly and \
forget about the concrete, then we begin to drift into a sea of unlimited \
possibilities \[Dash] a sea full of cunning settings, bulky (not just \
extensive) lists of parameters, infinite interfaces and irregular \
abstractions.In the pursuit of abstract flexibility, often (accidentally or \
deliberately) the valuable properties of alternative, simpler solutions are \
lost."],

nA software project can fail for many reasons.One of the most common sources \
of project failure is changing the schedule of work during the project \
execution without proper planning.Such failures can be avoided, but it \
requires considerable effort on the part of many people.Adjusting the \
timescale or adding resources to a project usually does not create any \
problems.Problems start when you are required to do more work in the same \
timeframe or shorten the schedule without reducing the load.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe \

delivery of a product is a very common misconception.Typically, overtime is \
used or \\\"less important tasks\\\" (such as modular testing) are sacrificed \
for faster delivery of the product or for enhanced functionality without \
changing the delivery time.Avoid such a scenario at all costs.Remind those \
who require such measures of you of the following facts:\\n\\n\\n\\n- \
Reducing design times leads to poor design quality and poor documentation, \
and also increases the likelihood of quality control problems and the risk \
that the system will not be accepted by the user.\\n\\n- The reduction in \
coding or delivery times is directly related to the number of errors in the \
final product.\\n\\n- Reducing test times leads to poorly tested code and is \
directly related to the number of tests problems. \\n\\n - All of this \
entails problems at the stage of operation, and the elimination of such \

a software product architecture.Trying to fulfil all the requirements at once \
(as in the case of the Vaza) creates an unstable architecture that does not \
solve exactly any of the tasks set.A good example of this is the requirement \
to force service-oriented architecture (SOA) to function as a point-to-point \
solution at the same time. Usually this forces to bypass the various levels \
of abstraction created by the SOA approach, and the result is an architecture \
resembling a spaghetti dish from an Italian restaurant.The architect has \
several tools at his disposal to identify the compromises to be taken when \
designing architectures. Two popular methods of this kind are ATAM \
(Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) and CBAM (Cost Benefit Analysis \
Metod).Further information on ATAM and CBAM can be found on the SEI (Software \

software architect should know and understand that you can't get everything \
at once. In practice, it is impossible to design an architecture that has \
high performance, high availability, high security and high abstraction at \
the same time.There is one real story that software architects need to know, \
understand and tell their clients and colleagues.I mean the history of the \
Vaza.\n\n\n\nIn 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. Wishing to \
put an end to this expensive war more quickly, the King of Sweden ordered the \
construction of a gallion called the Vase.It was an unusual ship.The \
requirements for it were not the same as for any other ship of the time.It \
was to be more than 60 metres long, carry 64 guns on two battery deck, and \
also carry 300 soldiers at a time for safe delivery to Poland by sea. Time \
was running out, there was a lack of money (sounds familiar, right?).The \
shipbuilder has never designed such ships before.He specialized in smaller, \
single-deck vessels. Nevertheless, he undertook the design and construction \
of the Vaza, relying on his previous experience.As a result, a ship that \
meets these specifications was built. It's the day of the water descent.The \
ship proudly sailed into the harbor, saluting out all the guns...And then he \
sank.\n\n\n\nThe Vaza problem was obvious; anyone who had seen the deck of a \
large 17th-century battleship knew that the decks of such ships were \
overcrowded and unsafe, especially during battle. It was a costly mistake to \
build ships that would serve both combat and transport.The shipbuilder, \
seeking to fulfil all the wishes of the king, created an unstable and poorly \
balanced ship.\n\n\n\nA software architect can draw a lot from this story and \
take this sad experience into account when designing a software product \
architecture.Trying to fulfil all the requirements at once (as in the case of \
the Vaza) creates an unstable architecture that does not solve exactly any of \

What you need is communication.\[NonBreakingSpace]  \\nAt the same time, \

communication with subordinates:\[NonBreakingSpace]  \\n\[Bullet] Consider \
the discussion of problems as a constructive dialogue rather than a conflict \
situation.  \\nStart from positive assumptions about people and view \
communication as an opportunity to ask questions that interest you, so you \
will definitely be able to get more useful information, and your \
interlocutors will not take a defensive position.\[NonBreakingSpace]  \\n\
\[Bullet] Start the conversation only in a mood suitable for communication.\
\[NonBreakingSpace]  \\nIf you are angry, irritated, upset, and out of \
balance in general, your interlocutor is likely to interpret your non-verbal \
manifestations as a sign of attack.\[NonBreakingSpace]  \\n\[Bullet] Use \
situations such as an opportunity to mutual benefit.\[NonBreakingSpace]  \
\\nDon't tell the developer to be quiet at meetings because he doesn't let \
anyone talk; ask him if he can help you get involved in other people's \
