development or operation for a long time, the first sign of real trouble is \
always a \\\"dirty\\\" log. You know what I'm talking about: it's when \
clicking a link during normal web page operation results in a whole stream of \
messages being recorded in the system's single log. An excessive number of \
log entries can be just as useless as their complete absence.\\n\\nIf your \
systems are similar to mine, then when your work ends, the work of other \
people begins. After the development is completed, the system will be \
long\\nand successfully serve customers (if you're lucky). How will you learn \
about problems if the system is in operation, and what will you do about \
them?\\n\\nPerhaps someone is monitoring the system instead of you, or maybe \
it is\\nyou do. In any case, monitoring probably involves \
viewing\\nmagazines. If something happens and you are woken up in the middle \
of the night, it is preferable that\\nthe reason was compelling. If my system \
is dying, I need to know about it. But\\nif she just hiccuped, I would prefer \
that my sweet sleep not be disturbed.\\n\\nIn many systems, the first sign of \
trouble is a message being logged in some kind of journal. Usually, it's the \
error log. So do yourself a favor: organize the process in such a way that \
from the very first day of development, as soon as something appears in the \
error log, you are woken up in the middle of the night by a phone call. If \
during system testing you can simulate the load on your system, a clean error \
log will likely testify to the reliability of your system, while a \
\\\"dirty\\\" one will serve as the first alarm signal.\\n\\nDistributed \
systems create an additional level of complexity. You need to decide how to \
handle failures of external dependencies. If the system is highly \
distributed, this can happen frequently. Take this into account when choosing \
a logging policy.\\n\\n\:0412 \:0446\:0435\:043b\:043e\:043c, \:043b\:0443\

modules and packages, classes, etc., are used to ensure \
isolation.\\n\\nModules and packages solve large-scale encapsulation tasks, \

for programmers is encapsulation in classes. It is not uncommon to encounter \
a class where the only main method has 5000 lines, or a class,\\nin which \
there are only set and get methods for its elementary attributes. \
Such\\nexamples show that the developers of these classes have not fully \
mastered object-oriented thinking and do not know how to leverage the power \
of objects as\\nmodeling structures. For those who are familiar with the term \
POJO (Plain Old\\nJava Object \[Dash] a simple Java object in the old style) \

then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks \
a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:\\n\\n-How is it \
possible to halt the container?\\nThe original data types in Python?\\nWhat \
is the PID of the Linux kernel?\\nHow are PACELC and CAP understood?\\n- -...\
\\n\\n\\n Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to \
create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. \\\"How do I \
send a message to the generator?\\\" Or even \\\"What does this code do?\\\" \
He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn't just ignore it in a \
review. Yes, I did notice that the reason we get a negative is because the \
second argument in sorted is merely named. I confirmed that the system \
doesn't care what Google completes in twenty-five seconds.\\n\\nDo you intend \
to host screenings of this nature? On the Skytrain, I heard one such unusual \
conversation. But even recruiters seem tired of outsiders applying for every \
available job without any prior knowledge of the company.\\n\\nBut roughly 20 \
percent of them had realized the power of the calendar at the same time. For \
whatever reason, they think the conversation ends when someone says, \\\"I \
made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the link...\\\" No, go away! \
Schedule! Given that I\\n\\n-I'll pick a time slot; I'll be forgetful; I'll \
break links; and I'll count for sixty minutes instead of sixty.\\nI don't get \
to know the other person right away.\\n- and it was typically at 1:30 pm UTC \
(not PST).\\n\\nThere needs to be a prerequisite exam for hiring a recruiter. \
\\\" Oh, \\\"Oh, free all day\\\" (and quiet, too...). Moreover, if you \
request a move because of illness, you will not be remembered at all. With \
the calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.\\n\\n## Real-Time \
Coding\\n\\nThere's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people enjoy \
the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), and \
one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following the \
interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, code-filled \
profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident from this that \
the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure that all \
candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. At the \
second, he'll ask himself, \\\"Do I really need this?\\\" It expires since \
there are currently three offers.\\n\\nYou usually have two tasks to finish. \
Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go \
back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated \
hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this \
hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help \
rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be \
disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \
of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) \\\"Because you \
probably have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\\\" Wonderful \
~{fail~~win!\\n\\nWith one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding \
experience I've ever had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me \
writing the more complex second and him writing the first. That's when I \
realized there was another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. \
We have a co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working \
at \\\"Big4\\\" doesn't always involve this.\\n\\nIt is also expected of \
students to work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount \
of additional RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so \
much, but it still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing \
and maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization \
problems with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview \
turns into an Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you \
ought to have thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck \
at all.\\n\\nThe interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason \
behind people's distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a \
laptop with a scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most \
popular; syntax illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with \
a task to find another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had \
were the white screen and the message \\\"Transfer money from account A to \
account B.\\\" Not even an interface, not even a template, not even a \
proposal for the BD... For ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they \
want to see. Consider taking writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all \
of this support code isn't very task-related.\\n\\nWhat steps do we need to \
take right now? What piqued my curiosity the most was the subject of the PR \
talk. Here, one can tell how someone will behave in a professional context \
straight away without having to use irony. What he is paying attention to, \
what he ignores, and why. For example, since formatting is the responsibility \
of linters, gentlemen typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more \
on APIs, races, and working optimally with the base. I really advise trying \
it out.\\n\\n## Architecture of the System\\n\\nSystem design interviews are \
another type of interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to \
create a system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out \
the architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, \
DFD, and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. \
Gathering requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and \
determining use cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most \
crucial things are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning \
face. They'll be behind you in forty minutes.\\n\\n## Knowledge assessment\\n\
\\nSo, I went over the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I \
exaggerated. No, though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, \
Python testing, and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the \
offer. Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only \
does it work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just \
coding, but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward \
and outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send \
soaps there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of \
course, but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks \
superficially in addition to not looking at all.\\n\\nTake the problem of \
figuring out the program's runtime, for example. Well, \\\"time.\\\" is \
challenging. I would have brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, \
the appropriate solution is to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but \
will we really take measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? \
seems time that seems boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring \
more, I learned that while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, \
they have no understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.\\n\\nIn \
addition, the NAC interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the \
individuals I will be working with. Then someone said, \\\"I have a few \
questions for you.\\\" For some reason, I thought we were incompatible \
immediately.\\n\\n## SRE/DevOps\\n\\nGiven that I had a lot of free time and \
was unemployed, I chose to interview with DevOps. Was it all for nothing\
\[LongDash]joking, snarky, still passed, but embarrassing to write about\
\[LongDash]the Linux course on Udemy? That's when I really started to like \
the process. The two processes in question were troubleshooting and general \
knowledge.\\n\\nThe interviewer mainly stuck to the list of questions, but he \
was also allowed to veer off topic from time to time, which enlivened the \
conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, databases, \
and functioning in containers. What is a universal phenomenon that exists in \
all forms throughout the universe? They might not have been so deeply, but a \
baccalaureate could have addressed them. In the end, the other person learned \
something new, and I gave them some resources to look into.\\n\\nIt was a \
troubleshooting role-playing game. Users report that even with a system in \
place, the website does not load. There are no notebooks or dashboards; \
instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be programmed to do or observe \
things. At least it was fun and as near to the real job as it gets. It's not \
a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. And in this instance, the \
scientific method is subordinated to actual observations. The system's \
condition at the time of the incident must be partially known to the \
SRE.\\n\\n## Advice for prospective candidates\\n\\nOver the last five years, \
I've conducted several hundred interviews with both sides. A few life tips \
are as follows:\\n\\nYou are going to have to go through the windshields. You \
won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you apply your skills, either \
something exciting arises out of the blue or it will be the only place with \
the offer. You never know what might be found within a candy box.\\n\\n -Get \
some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The same live code is kind of dumb; \
the response will appear immediately even if it doesn't appear during the \
request.\\nFill up a glass with water. When faced with any unclear situation, \
drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\\nTalk to me. It's a good \
idea to talk about distracting topics with your coworker or cat prior to the \
conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\\nStay at ease. It may be \
more challenging, for sure, but after a year or two, you'll even say, \
\\\"Thank you.\\\" This way of thinking will help to reduce the degree of \
stiffness to some extent.\\nMake sure to solicit feedback from others. \
Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\\n\\n\\nI would want to \
remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you \
weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't \
make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along \
with the statements, \\\"We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the \
penny against Quater,\\\" and that I was \\\"overqualified.\\\" Perhaps there \
isn't a position available for me.\\n\\n## Interviewers' \
suggestions\\n\\nMore empathy. Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove \
him; your role is to assess whether communication is comfortable between you \
both and whether he can fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not \
possible to complete it in one and a half hours.\\n\\n## Lack of \
conviction\\n\\n Most of them were start-ups or small enterprises with 20\
\[Dash]30 employees. Consequently, a discernible distinction exists between \
their interviews and the ones conducted by the corporation. Recruiters \
receive a lot of resumes and job openings, so at first, bold decisions could \
appear possible. For example, following seven fruitful interviews, I received \
word that I could not be recruited. How absurd is that? But I can use their \
hiring for streaming as a justification. Everyone is being seriously taken \
advantage of by them, \\\"and we're going to figure it out someday.\\\" \
Additionally, all of the procedures are fully standardized. Whether you're a \
senior Python student with fifteen years of referral experience or not, you \
go through every step of misery.\"\>"}],

   "I would want to share some insights from my recent return to \
interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in \
large organizations.\n\n## Examining\n\nTech-screening then takes off like \
wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions \
during the first call. As an example:\n\n-How is it possible to halt the \
container?\nThe original data types in Python?\nWhat is the PID of the Linux \
kernel?\nHow are PACELC and CAP understood?\n- -...\n\n\n Some even go so far \
as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty \
queries in twenty minutes. \"How do I send a message to the generator?\" Or \
even \"What does this code do?\" He knows that the code is so strange that I \
wouldn't just ignore it in a review. Yes, I did notice that the reason we get \
a negative is because the second argument in sorted is merely named. I \
confirmed that the system doesn't care what Google completes in twenty-five \
seconds.\n\nDo you intend to host screenings of this nature? On the Skytrain, \
I heard one such unusual conversation. But even recruiters seem tired of \
outsiders applying for every available job without any prior knowledge of the \
company.\n\nBut roughly 20 percent of them had realized the power of the \
calendar at the same time. For whatever reason, they think the conversation \
ends when someone says, \"I made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the \
link...\" No, go away! Schedule! Given that I\n\n-I'll pick a time slot; I'll \
be forgetful; I'll break links; and I'll count for sixty minutes instead of \
sixty.\nI don't get to know the other person right away.\n- and it was \
typically at 1:30 pm UTC (not PST).\n\nThere needs to be a prerequisite exam \
for hiring a recruiter. \" Oh, \"Oh, free all day\" (and quiet, too...). \
Moreover, if you request a move because of illness, you will not be \
remembered at all. With the calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.\n\n## \
Real-Time Coding\n\nThere's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people \
enjoy the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), \
and one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following \
the interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, \
code-filled profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident \
from this that the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure \
that all candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. \
At the second, he'll ask himself, \"Do I really need this?\" It expires since \
there are currently three offers.\n\nYou usually have two tasks to finish. \
Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go \
back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated \
hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this \
hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help \
rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be \
disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \
of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) \"Because you probably \
have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\" Wonderful ~{fail~~win!\n\n\
With one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding experience I've ever \
had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me writing the more \
complex second and him writing the first. That's when I realized there was \
another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. We have a \
co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working at \
\"Big4\" doesn't always involve this.\n\nIt is also expected of students to \
work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount of additional \
RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so much, but it \
still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing and \
maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization problems \
with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview turns into an \
Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you ought to have \
thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck at all.\n\n\
The interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason behind people's \
distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a laptop with a \
scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most popular; syntax \
illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with a task to find \
another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had were the white \
screen and the message \"Transfer money from account A to account B.\" Not \
even an interface, not even a template, not even a proposal for the BD... For \
ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they want to see. Consider taking \
writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all of this support code isn't \
very task-related.\n\nWhat steps do we need to take right now? What piqued my \
curiosity the most was the subject of the PR talk. Here, one can tell how \
someone will behave in a professional context straight away without having to \
use irony. What he is paying attention to, what he ignores, and why. For \
example, since formatting is the responsibility of linters, gentlemen \
typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more on APIs, races, and \
working optimally with the base. I really advise trying it out.\n\n## \
Architecture of the System\n\nSystem design interviews are another type of \
interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to create a \
system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out the \
architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, \
and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. Gathering \
requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and determining use \
cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most crucial things \
are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning face. They'll \
be behind you in forty minutes.\n\n## Knowledge assessment\n\nSo, I went over \

SRE.\\n\\n## Advice for prospective candidates\\n\\nOver the last five years, \
I've conducted several hundred interviews with both sides. A few life tips \
are as follows:\\n\\nYou are going to have to go through the windshields. You \
won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you apply your skills, either \
something exciting arises out of the blue or it will be the only place with \
the offer. You never know what might be found within a candy box.\\n\\n -Get \
some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The same live code is kind of dumb; \
the response will appear immediately even if it doesn't appear during the \
request.\\nFill up a glass with water. When faced with any unclear situation, \
drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\\nTalk to me. It's a good \
idea to talk about distracting topics with your coworker or cat prior to the \
conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\\nStay at ease. It may be \
more challenging, for sure, but after a year or two, you'll even say, \
\\\"Thank you.\\\" This way of thinking will help to reduce the degree of \
stiffness to some extent.\\nMake sure to solicit feedback from others. \
Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\\n\\n\\nI would want to \
remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you \
weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't \
make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along \
with the statements, \\\"We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the \
penny against Quater,\\\" and that I was \\\"overqualified.\\\" Perhaps there \
isn't a position available for me.\\n\\n## Interviewers' \
suggestions\\n\\nMore empathy. Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove \
him; your role is to assess whether communication is comfortable between you \
both and whether he can fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not \
possible to complete it in one and a half hours.\\n\\n## Lack of \
conviction\\n\\n Most of them were start-ups or small enterprises with 20\
\[Dash]30 employees. Consequently, a discernible distinction exists between \
their interviews and the ones conducted by the corporation. Recruiters \
receive a lot of resumes and job openings, so at first, bold decisions could \
appear possible. For example, following seven fruitful interviews, I received \
word that I could not be recruited. How absurd is that? But I can use their \
hiring for streaming as a justification. Everyone is being seriously taken \
advantage of by them, \\\"and we're going to figure it out someday.\\\" \
Additionally, all of the procedures are fully standardized. Whether you're a \
senior Python student with fifteen years of referral experience or not, you \
go through every step of misery.\"\>"}],

cover_image='/images/cover/knoxwelle__2019-04-06T083343.000Z.jpg'\n+++\nI \
would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This \
episode covers employment process design and screening in large \
organizations.\n\n## Examining\n\nTech-screening then takes off like \
wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions \
during the first call. As an example:\n\n-How is it possible to halt the \
container?\nThe original data types in Python?\nWhat is the PID of the Linux \
kernel?\nHow are PACELC and CAP understood?\n- -...\n\n\n Some even go so far \
as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty \
queries in twenty minutes. \"How do I send a message to the generator?\" Or \
even \"What does this code do?\" He knows that the code is so strange that I \
wouldn't just ignore it in a review. Yes, I did notice that the reason we get \
a negative is because the second argument in sorted is merely named. I \
confirmed that the system doesn't care what Google completes in twenty-five \
seconds.\n\nDo you intend to host screenings of this nature? On the Skytrain, \
I heard one such unusual conversation. But even recruiters seem tired of \
outsiders applying for every available job without any prior knowledge of the \
company.\n\nBut roughly 20 percent of them had realized the power of the \
calendar at the same time. For whatever reason, they think the conversation \
ends when someone says, \"I made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the \
link...\" No, go away! Schedule! Given that I\n\n-I'll pick a time slot; I'll \
be forgetful; I'll break links; and I'll count for sixty minutes instead of \
sixty.\nI don't get to know the other person right away.\n- and it was \
typically at 1:30 pm UTC (not PST).\n\nThere needs to be a prerequisite exam \
for hiring a recruiter. \" Oh, \"Oh, free all day\" (and quiet, too...). \
Moreover, if you request a move because of illness, you will not be \
remembered at all. With the calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.\n\n## \
Real-Time Coding\n\nThere's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people \
enjoy the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), \
and one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following \
the interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, \
code-filled profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident \
from this that the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure \
that all candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. \
At the second, he'll ask himself, \"Do I really need this?\" It expires since \
there are currently three offers.\n\nYou usually have two tasks to finish. \
Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go \
back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated \
hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this \
hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help \
rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be \
disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \
of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) \"Because you probably \
have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\" Wonderful ~{fail~~win!\n\n\
With one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding experience I've ever \
had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me writing the more \
complex second and him writing the first. That's when I realized there was \
another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. We have a \
co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working at \
\"Big4\" doesn't always involve this.\n\nIt is also expected of students to \
work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount of additional \
RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so much, but it \
still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing and \
maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization problems \
with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview turns into an \
Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you ought to have \
thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck at all.\n\n\
The interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason behind people's \
distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a laptop with a \
scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most popular; syntax \
illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with a task to find \
another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had were the white \
screen and the message \"Transfer money from account A to account B.\" Not \
even an interface, not even a template, not even a proposal for the BD... For \
ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they want to see. Consider taking \
writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all of this support code isn't \
very task-related.\n\nWhat steps do we need to take right now? What piqued my \
curiosity the most was the subject of the PR talk. Here, one can tell how \
someone will behave in a professional context straight away without having to \
use irony. What he is paying attention to, what he ignores, and why. For \
example, since formatting is the responsibility of linters, gentlemen \
typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more on APIs, races, and \
working optimally with the base. I really advise trying it out.\n\n## \
Architecture of the System\n\nSystem design interviews are another type of \
interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to create a \
system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out the \
architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, \
and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. Gathering \
requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and determining use \
cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most crucial things \
are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning face. They'll \
be behind you in forty minutes.\n\n## Knowledge assessment\n\nSo, I went over \
the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I exaggerated. No, \
though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, Python testing, \
and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the offer. \
Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only does it \
work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just coding, \
but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward and \
outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send soaps \
there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of course, \
but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks superficially in \
addition to not looking at all.\n\nTake the problem of figuring out the \
program's runtime, for example. Well, \"time.\" is challenging. I would have \
brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, the appropriate solution is \
to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but will we really take \
measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? seems time that seems \
boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring more, I learned that \
while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, they have no \
understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.\n\nIn addition, the NAC \
interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the individuals I will \
be working with. Then someone said, \"I have a few questions for you.\" For \
some reason, I thought we were incompatible immediately.\n\n## SRE/DevOps\n\n\
Given that I had a lot of free time and was unemployed, I chose to interview \
with DevOps. Was it all for nothing\[LongDash]joking, snarky, still passed, \
but embarrassing to write about\[LongDash]the Linux course on Udemy? That's \
when I really started to like the process. The two processes in question were \
troubleshooting and general knowledge.\n\nThe interviewer mainly stuck to the \
list of questions, but he was also allowed to veer off topic from time to \
time, which enlivened the conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux \
loading, networking, databases, and functioning in containers. What is a \
universal phenomenon that exists in all forms throughout the universe? They \
might not have been so deeply, but a baccalaureate could have addressed them. \
In the end, the other person learned something new, and I gave them some \
resources to look into.\n\nIt was a troubleshooting role-playing game. Users \
report that even with a system in place, the website does not load. There are \
no notebooks or dashboards; instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be \
programmed to do or observe things. At least it was fun and as near to the \
real job as it gets. It's not a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. \
And in this instance, the scientific method is subordinated to actual \
observations. The system's condition at the time of the incident must be \
partially known to the SRE.\n\n## Advice for prospective candidates\n\nOver \
the last five years, I've conducted several hundred interviews with both \
sides. A few life tips are as follows:\n\nYou are going to have to go through \
the windshields. You won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you \
apply your skills, either something exciting arises out of the blue or it \
will be the only place with the offer. You never know what might be found \
within a candy box.\n\n -Get some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The \
same live code is kind of dumb; the response will appear immediately even if \
it doesn't appear during the request.\nFill up a glass with water. When faced \
with any unclear situation, drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\n\
Talk to me. It's a good idea to talk about distracting topics with your \
coworker or cat prior to the conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\
\nStay at ease. It may be more challenging, for sure, but after a year or \
two, you'll even say, \"Thank you.\" This way of thinking will help to reduce \
the degree of stiffness to some extent.\nMake sure to solicit feedback from \
others. Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\n\n\nI would want to \

Recently, I was at the grocery store and searched everywhere for edamame, \
green soybeans (I only vaguely guessed that they were some kind of \
vegetable). I didn't know where to look for this product: in the vegetable \
section, in the frozen food section, or on the canned goods shelves? Finally, \
I gave up and asked a store employee for help. She didn't know either!\n\nThe \
store employee could have reacted to my request in different ways. She could \
have made it clear to me that only a fool doesn't know where to look for it, \
or given vague hints, or even just said that they don't have such a product. \
But she deemed it possible to find a solution and help the customer. Calling \
other employees, she led me to the needed product in just a couple of \
minutes. Edamame turned out to be in the frozen foods section.\n\nIn this \
situation, the employee listened to the request and started from the premise \
that\nThe problem will be resolved, and the request will be fulfilled. She \
started by saying yes instead of no.\n\nWhen I first had to take on the role \
of technical lead, it seemed to me that the main part of my job was to \
protect my wonderful programs from the stream of absurd demands coming from \
product managers and business analysts. In most conversations, I viewed any \
request as an attack that required a defensive response rather than a \
positive answer. \n\nAt some point, I had an epiphany and realized that there \
is another approach to work that differs from mine, which is simply starting \
with a yes instead of a no. I came to the conclusion that starting a \
conversation with a positive answer is the most important part of a technical \
leader's job.\n\nThis simple change radically transformed my approach to \
work. It turned out there are many ways to communicate. When you hear, \
\"Listen, this app will be a hundred times cooler if we make all the windows \
round and transparent!\" you might dismiss this suggestion as ridiculous. But \
usually, it's better to first ask, \"Why?\" Often, there is a real and \
compelling reason why this person insists on round transparent windows. For \
example, negotiations are underway with a new major client whose \
standardization committee requires these very round transparent windows.\n\n\
Usually, after familiarizing yourself with the context of the request, you \
find that new opportunities arise. Often, the request can be fulfilled within \
the existing product in some other way, allowing for an easy \"yes\" \
response: \"Actually, you can upload a skin with round transparent windows in \
the user settings and activate it.\"\n\nSometimes people come up with ideas \
that seem incompatible with your vision of the product. I have found that in \
this case, it is usually helpful to ask yourself the question \"why.\" \
Sometimes, the very attempt to explain the reason to oneself helps to \
understand the error in the initial reaction. If this is not the case, then \
you can ease the situation by involving other responsible parties in the \
discussion. Remember that the goal of all this is to say yes to another \
person and try to make it work, not only for them but for yourself and your \
entire team.\n\nIf you can convincingly explain why the proposed feature is \
incompatible with the existing product, it will allow for a constructive \
discussion about whether the product you are creating is necessary. \
Regardless of the discussion's outcome, each participant will have a clearer \
understanding of what the product is and what it is not.\nStarting with yes \

imagine how this circumstance affects the weight of the aircraft.\nWhen the \
design team asked the Air Force customers why they needed a speed of \
M2\[Dash]2.5, they replied: \"So the aircraft can disengage from combat if \
necessary.\" When the real need became evident, the designers were able to \
solve the main problem and present a workable solution: a maneuverable \
aircraft with high thrust-to-weight ratio, ensuring good acceleration and \
maneuverability instead of high maximum speed."],

business analytics? If you break this phrase down into words, it is the \
analysis of business requirements. This is not design, this is not \
programming, this is precisely requirements analysis. The main task is to \
help the client understand what they actually need. However, clients and end \
users often present what they believe to be an effective solution to a \
problem as a requirement. That is, they themselves, as it seems to them, have \
already found all the solutions and want them to be implemented. The \
effectiveness of this is quite questionable, as it leads to an overload of \
the project with requirements, which often contradict each other, as well as \
a significant increase in its cost. In exceptional cases, the project becomes \
completely unfeasible.\\n\\nA classic example of this kind is provided by \
Harry Hillaker, the chief designer of the F-16 Falcon fighter jet. His group \
was tasked with designing an aircraft capable of speeds of M2\[Dash]2.5, \
which was (and likely still is) a rather non-trivial challenge, especially if \
the accompanying goal was to create a \\\"cheap\\\" lightweight \
aircraft.\\nConsider that the force required to overcome air resistance \
quadruples when the flight speed doubles, and imagine how this circumstance \
affects the weight of the aircraft.\\nWhen the design team asked the Air \
Force customers why they needed a speed of M2\[Dash]2.5, they replied: \\\"So \
the aircraft can disengage from combat if necessary.\\\" When the real need \
became evident, the designers were able to solve the main problem and present \
a workable solution: a maneuverable aircraft with high thrust-to-weight \
ratio, ensuring good acceleration and maneuverability instead of high maximum \
speed.\\n\\nThe conclusions from this lesson are equally applicable in the \

what the client insists on. Increased attention to the essence of the \

   "What if it's impossible to find another project (hello, Big4), and you \
still have to participate in such an event? Well, of course, the question \
arises whether you want to implement this trendy technology yourself or if \
you are acting on orders from above. If you work in consulting, then \
utilization will be a priority for you. At the interview, you can even \
mention what an enthusiast you are - but don't exaggerate. Those clients who \
have already been burned by such dead-end solutions will not be happy to see \
you. Both for yourself and for everyone else, it will be better if you choose \
technology in the interest of the client, rather than for your own resume. \
Sometimes it's hard to resist the temptation to apply a new trendy solution, \
even if it doesn't fit the current situation well."],

+++\nThe performance of an application is determined by its architecture. At \
first glance, it seems that this statement should be obvious, but real-world \
experience shows otherwise. For example, software architects often believe \
that application performance issues can be resolved simply by switching to \
software infrastructure from another vendor. The source of this belief may be \
the advertising hype surrounding testing results \[Dash] for example, it is \
claimed that the leading company's product outperforms the nearest competitor \
by a certain percentage. However, if the leading product performs an \
operation in 3 milliseconds, and the competing product does it in 4 \
milliseconds, the claimed percentage (one millisecond) means very little \
against the backdrop of overall low performance rooted in architectural \
inefficiency.\n\nBesides IT managers and performance testing teams, there are \
other groups of people, such as the support service of the development \
company and authors of books on application performance management, who \
recommend fine-tuning the application's infrastructure: playing with memory \
allocation operations, connection pool sizes, thread pool sizes, and so on. \
But if the application is not designed efficiently enough for the expected \
load or its functional architecture irrationally uses computational \
resources, then no fine-tuning will ensure the desired performance and \
scalability. A complete redesign of the internal logic and/or deployment \
strategy will be required.\n\nUltimately, behind the facade of any \
manufacturer's product and the architecture of any application, the same \
fundamental principles of distributed data processing and physical laws \
apply: applications and the products they use operate as processes on \
computers with limited power, interacting with each other through protocol \
stacks and communication channels with non-zero latencies. Therefore, people \
should understand and accept the idea that the architecture of an application \
is the main factor determining its performance and scalability. These \
qualitative characteristics cannot be improved as if by \
magic\[LongDash]through a miraculous change of technologies or fine-tuning of \
infrastructure. Any improvements in these areas require hard work on careful \
architecture development."],
