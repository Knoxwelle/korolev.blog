nI've been going to interviews again, and I'd like to share some \
observations. This time we talk about live coding in enterprise companies and \
how the recruitment process should be constructed.\\n\\n## Live \
Coding\\n\\nThere's always a lot of noise around him. Some people like it \
(interviews), some people don't like it at all (candidates), and someone goes \
to a psychologist after him for six months. This is not really to understand \
that the candidate is able to code, not enough extensive projects on github, \
profile articles with code, reports after all... As I was told, this is done \
to ensure that everyone is equal in recruitment. Well, good luck hiring a \
leader or a gentleman in five rounds. At the second, he'll ask himself, \
\\\"Do I really need this? Well, there are already 3 offers,\\\" and it will \
fall off.\\n\\nAll right, live coding. Usually you get two tasks to program. \
Yeah, turn the trees. (Do you know what roffle? You come to them later, and \
they don't have any trees at all. There's an hour for everything. And how \
this hour will pass very much depends on the interlocutor. There are those \
who help reason, elaborate the IDE, set up a two-point and, if forgotten, \
show some kind of empathy and support\[LongDash]the candidate is still in \
stress. Take care of them! Much more often I get those who don't even turn on \
the cameras. They just give a job and watch the attempts. At one of these \
sessions, I solved a three-hour task. Did I get an offer? No. \\\"Because you \
probably have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\\\" Epic \
~~fail~~win!\\n\\nThe most interesting live coding I've ever had was with one \
Canadian. We discussed and solved the problem together. Literally together\
\[LongDash]he wrote one part, I wrote the second, more complicated. And \
that's when I realized another problem of this \
session\[LongDash]one-sidedness. We have a co-interview at the end of the \
day. That is, the candidate should look after future colleagues. Can they \
code too? Working at VOTVASYA does not always involve this.\\n\\nAnd in a \
well-known company, they are asked to solve the problems for O(1), but it \
does not care about the amount of additional memory. It's easy to understand \
why their app weighs so much, but it still brakes. But the nuance is that in \
practice, such code is much more difficult to write and maintain because of \
the problems of synchronization of these very data structures. And it turns \
out that the interview turns into an Olympiad, and there, how \
lucky\[LongDash]if you slept, come up with a solution; no\[LongDash]nothing, \
you come up before sleeping.\\n\\nAnother reason why people do not like \
online programming is that the interviewer is not prepared. Encoding in a \
notebook with a scratched screen still occurs. Most often, of course, just \
some kind of online editor, and good if with syntax lighting. But to find \
such another half-business, you have to come up with a challenge. The \
