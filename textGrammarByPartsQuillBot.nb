review. Yes, I did notice that the reason we get a negative is because the \
second argument in sorted is merely named. I confirmed that the system \
doesn't care what Google completes in twenty-five seconds.\\n\\nDo you intend \
to host screenings of this nature? On the Skytrain, I heard one such unusual \
conversation. But even recruiters seem tired of outsiders applying for every \
available job without any prior knowledge of the company.\\n\\nBut roughly 20 \
percent of them had realized the power of the calendar at the same time. For \
whatever reason, they think the conversation ends when someone says, \\\"I \
made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the link...\\\" No, go away! \
Schedule! Given that I\\n\\n-I'll pick a time slot; I'll be forgetful; I'll \

(not PST).\\n\\nThere needs to be a prerequisite exam for hiring a recruiter. \
\\\" Oh, \\\"Oh, free all day\\\" (and quiet, too...). Moreover, if you \
request a move because of illness, you will not be remembered at all. With \
the calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.\\n\\n## Real-Time \
Coding\\n\\nThere's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people enjoy \
the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), and \
one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following the \
interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, code-filled \
profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident from this that \
the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure that all \
candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. At the \
second, he'll ask himself, \\\"Do I really need this?\\\" It expires since \
there are currently three offers.\\n\\nYou usually have two tasks to finish. \
Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go \
back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated \
hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this \
hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help \
rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be \
disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \
of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) \\\"Because you \
probably have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\\\" Wonderful \
~{fail~~win!\\n\\nWith one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding \
experience I've ever had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me \
writing the more complex second and him writing the first. That's when I \
realized there was another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. \
We have a co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working \
at \\\"Big4\\\" doesn't always involve this.\\n\\nIt is also expected of \
students to work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount \
of additional RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so \
much, but it still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing \
and maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization \
problems with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview \
turns into an Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you \
ought to have thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck \
at all.\\n\\nThe interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason \
behind people's distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a \
laptop with a scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most \
popular; syntax illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with \
a task to find another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had \
were the white screen and the message \\\"Transfer money from account A to \
account B.\\\" Not even an interface, not even a template, not even a \
proposal for the BD... For ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they \
want to see. Consider taking writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all \
of this support code isn't very task-related.\\n\\nWhat steps do we need to \
take right now? What piqued my curiosity the most was the subject of the PR \
talk. Here, one can tell how someone will behave in a professional context \
straight away without having to use irony. What he is paying attention to, \
what he ignores, and why. For example, since formatting is the responsibility \
of linters, gentlemen typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more \
on APIs, races, and working optimally with the base. I really advise trying \
it out.\\n\\n## Architecture of the System\\n\\nSystem design interviews are \
another type of interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to \
create a system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out \
the architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, \
DFD, and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. \
Gathering requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and \
determining use cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most \
crucial things are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning \
face. They'll be behind you in forty minutes.\\n\\n## Knowledge assessment\\n\
\\nSo, I went over the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I \
exaggerated. No, though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, \
Python testing, and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the \
offer. Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only \
does it work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just \
coding, but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward \
and outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send \
soaps there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of \
course, but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks \
superficially in addition to not looking at all.\\n\\nTake the problem of \
figuring out the program's runtime, for example. Well, \\\"time.\\\" is \
challenging. I would have brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, \
the appropriate solution is to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but \
will we really take measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? \
seems time that seems boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring \
more, I learned that while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, \
they have no understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.\\n\\nIn \
addition, the NAC interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the \
individuals I will be working with. Then someone said, \\\"I have a few \
questions for you.\\\" For some reason, I thought we were incompatible \
immediately.\\n\\n## SRE/DevOps\\n\\nGiven that I had a lot of free time and \
was unemployed, I chose to interview with DevOps. Was it all for nothing\
\[LongDash]joking, snarky, still passed, but embarrassing to write about\
\[LongDash]the Linux course on Udemy? That's when I really started to like \
the process. The two processes in question were troubleshooting and general \
knowledge.\\n\\nThe interviewer mainly stuck to the list of questions, but he \
was also allowed to veer off topic from time to time, which enlivened the \
conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, databases, \
and functioning in containers. What is a universal phenomenon that exists in \
all forms throughout the universe? They might not have been so deeply, but a \
baccalaureate could have addressed them. In the end, the other person learned \
something new, and I gave them some resources to look into.\\n\\nIt was a \
troubleshooting role-playing game. Users report that even with a system in \
place, the website does not load. There are no notebooks or dashboards; \
instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be programmed to do or observe \
things. At least it was fun and as near to the real job as it gets. It's not \
a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. And in this instance, the \
scientific method is subordinated to actual observations. The system's \
condition at the time of the incident must be partially known to the \
SRE.\\n\\n## Advice for prospective candidates\\n\\nOver the last five years, \
I've conducted several hundred interviews with both sides. A few life tips \
are as follows:\\n\\nYou are going to have to go through the windshields. You \
won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you apply your skills, either \
something exciting arises out of the blue or it will be the only place with \
the offer. You never know what might be found within a candy box.\\n\\n -Get \
some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The same live code is kind of dumb; \
the response will appear immediately even if it doesn't appear during the \
request.\\nFill up a glass with water. When faced with any unclear situation, \
drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\\nTalk to me. It's a good \
idea to talk about distracting topics with your coworker or cat prior to the \
conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\\nStay at ease. It may be \
more challenging, for sure, but after a year or two, you'll even say, \
\\\"Thank you.\\\" This way of thinking will help to reduce the degree of \
stiffness to some extent.\\nMake sure to solicit feedback from others. \
Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\\n\\n\\nI would want to \
remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you \
weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't \
make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along \
with the statements, \\\"We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the \
penny against Quater,\\\" and that I was \\\"overqualified.\\\" Perhaps there \
isn't a position available for me.\\n\\n## Interviewers' \
suggestions\\n\\nMore empathy. Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove \
him; your role is to assess whether communication is comfortable between you \
both and whether he can fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not \
possible to complete it in one and a half hours.\\n\\n## Lack of \
conviction\\n\\n Most of them were start-ups or small enterprises with 20\
\[Dash]30 employees. Consequently, a discernible distinction exists between \
their interviews and the ones conducted by the corporation. Recruiters \
receive a lot of resumes and job openings, so at first, bold decisions could \
appear possible. For example, following seven fruitful interviews, I received \
word that I could not be recruited. How absurd is that? But I can use their \
hiring for streaming as a justification. Everyone is being seriously taken \

disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \
of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) \\\"Because you \
probably have a choice, so we're not going to communicate.\\\" Wonderful \
~{fail~~win!\\n\\nWith one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding \
experience I've ever had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me \
writing the more complex second and him writing the first. That's when I \
realized there was another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. \
We have a co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working \
at \\\"Big4\\\" doesn't always involve this.\\n\\nIt is also expected of \
students to work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount \
of additional RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so \
much, but it still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing \
and maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization \
problems with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview \
turns into an Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you \
ought to have thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck \
at all.\\n\\nThe interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason \
behind people's distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a \
laptop with a scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most \
popular; syntax illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with \
a task to find another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had \
were the white screen and the message \\\"Transfer money from account A to \
account B.\\\" Not even an interface, not even a template, not even a \
proposal for the BD... For ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they \
want to see. Consider taking writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all \
of this support code isn't very task-related.\\n\\nWhat steps do we need to \
take right now? What piqued my curiosity the most was the subject of the PR \
talk. Here, one can tell how someone will behave in a professional context \
straight away without having to use irony. What he is paying attention to, \
what he ignores, and why. For example, since formatting is the responsibility \
of linters, gentlemen typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more \
on APIs, races, and working optimally with the base. I really advise trying \
it out.\\n\\n## Architecture of the System\\n\\nSystem design interviews are \
another type of interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to \
create a system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out \
the architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, \
DFD, and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. \
Gathering requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and \
determining use cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most \
crucial things are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning \
face. They'll be behind you in forty minutes.\\n\\n## Knowledge assessment\\n\
\\nSo, I went over the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I \
exaggerated. No, though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, \
Python testing, and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the \
offer. Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only \
does it work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just \
coding, but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward \
and outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send \
soaps there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of \
course, but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks \
superficially in addition to not looking at all.\\n\\nTake the problem of \
figuring out the program's runtime, for example. Well, \\\"time.\\\" is \
challenging. I would have brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, \
the appropriate solution is to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but \
will we really take measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? \
seems time that seems boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring \
more, I learned that while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, \
they have no understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.\\n\\nIn \
addition, the NAC interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the \
individuals I will be working with. Then someone said, \\\"I have a few \
questions for you.\\\" For some reason, I thought we were incompatible \
immediately.\\n\\n## SRE/DevOps\\n\\nGiven that I had a lot of free time and \
was unemployed, I chose to interview with DevOps. Was it all for nothing\
\[LongDash]joking, snarky, still passed, but embarrassing to write about\
\[LongDash]the Linux course on Udemy? That's when I really started to like \
the process. The two processes in question were troubleshooting and general \
knowledge.\\n\\nThe interviewer mainly stuck to the list of questions, but he \
was also allowed to veer off topic from time to time, which enlivened the \
conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, databases, \
and functioning in containers. What is a universal phenomenon that exists in \
all forms throughout the universe? They might not have been so deeply, but a \
baccalaureate could have addressed them. In the end, the other person learned \
something new, and I gave them some resources to look into.\\n\\nIt was a \
troubleshooting role-playing game. Users report that even with a system in \
place, the website does not load. There are no notebooks or dashboards; \
instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be programmed to do or observe \
things. At least it was fun and as near to the real job as it gets. It's not \
a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. And in this instance, the \
scientific method is subordinated to actual observations. The system's \
condition at the time of the incident must be partially known to the \
SRE.\\n\\n## Advice for prospective candidates\\n\\nOver the last five years, \
I've conducted several hundred interviews with both sides. A few life tips \
are as follows:\\n\\nYou are going to have to go through the windshields. You \
won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you apply your skills, either \
something exciting arises out of the blue or it will be the only place with \
the offer. You never know what might be found within a candy box.\\n\\n -Get \
some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The same live code is kind of dumb; \
the response will appear immediately even if it doesn't appear during the \
request.\\nFill up a glass with water. When faced with any unclear situation, \
drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.\\nTalk to me. It's a good \
idea to talk about distracting topics with your coworker or cat prior to the \
conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.\\nStay at ease. It may be \
more challenging, for sure, but after a year or two, you'll even say, \
\\\"Thank you.\\\" This way of thinking will help to reduce the degree of \
stiffness to some extent.\\nMake sure to solicit feedback from others. \
Without feedback, learning is very challenging.\\n\\n\\nI would want to \
remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you \
weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't \
make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along \
with the statements, \\\"We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the \
penny against Quater,\\\" and that I was \\\"overqualified.\\\" Perhaps there \
isn't a position available for me.\\n\\n## Interviewers' \
suggestions\\n\\nMore empathy. Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove \
him; your role is to assess whether communication is comfortable between you \
both and whether he can fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not \
possible to complete it in one and a half hours.\\n\\n## Lack of \
conviction\\n\\n Most of them were start-ups or small enterprises with 20\
\[Dash]30 employees. Consequently, a discernible distinction exists between \
their interviews and the ones conducted by the corporation. Recruiters \
receive a lot of resumes and job openings, so at first, bold decisions could \
appear possible. For example, following seven fruitful interviews, I received \
word that I could not be recruited. How absurd is that? But I can use their \
hiring for streaming as a justification. Everyone is being seriously taken \
advantage of by them, \\\"and we're going to figure it out someday.\\\" \
Additionally, all of the procedures are fully standardized. Whether you're a \
senior Python student with fifteen years of referral experience or not, you \
go through every step of misery.\"\>"}],

+++\nI would want to share some insights from my recent return to \
interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in \
large organizations.\n\n## Examining\n\nTech-screening then takes off like \
wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions \
during the first call. As an example:\n\n-How is it possible to halt the \
container?\nThe original data types in Python?\nWhat is the PID of the Linux \
kernel?\nHow are PACELC and CAP understood?\n- -...\n\n\n Some even go so far \
as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty \
queries in twenty minutes. \"How do I send a message to the generator?\" Or \
even \"What does this code do?\" He knows that the code is so strange that I \
wouldn't just ignore it in a review. Yes, I did notice that the reason we get \
a negative is because the second argument in sorted is merely named. I \
confirmed that the system doesn't care what Google completes in twenty-five \
seconds.\n\nDo you intend to host screenings of this nature? On the Skytrain, \
I heard one such unusual conversation. But even recruiters seem tired of \
outsiders applying for every available job without any prior knowledge of the \
company.\n\nBut roughly 20 percent of them had realized the power of the \
calendar at the same time. For whatever reason, they think the conversation \
ends when someone says, \"I made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the \
link...\" No, go away! Schedule! Given that I\n\n-I'll pick a time slot; I'll \
be forgetful; I'll break links; and I'll count for sixty minutes instead of \
sixty.\nI don't get to know the other person right away.\n- and it was \
typically at 1:30 pm UTC (not PST).\n\nThere needs to be a prerequisite exam \
for hiring a recruiter. \" Oh, \"Oh, free all day\" (and quiet, too...). \
Moreover, if you request a move because of illness, you will not be \
remembered at all. With the calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.\n\n## \
Real-Time Coding\n\nThere's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people \
enjoy the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), \
and one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following \
the interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, \
code-filled profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident \
from this that the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure \
that all candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. \
At the second, he'll ask himself, \"Do I really need this?\" It expires since \
there are currently three offers.\n\nYou usually have two tasks to finish. \
Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go \
back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated \
hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this \
hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help \
rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be \
disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! \
Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their \
cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one \

and creative search rather than production and design. In software \
development, concepts from conventional engineering disciplines are \
inapplicable. Leading scholars in our profession have spent more than 30 \
years documenting and analyzing the issues that emerge. For instance, in the \
\"Rapport of the Ratifying Group of the Ministry of Defense Scientific \
Council on Military Software,\" Frederick Brooks, Jr. contended in 1987 that \
a lot of software issues stemmed from the document-oriented methodology of \
\"first specification, then development.\"."],

nProgramming is learning, according to Kristen Nygaard, the creator of the \
object-oriented mapping and programming language Simula. Improving \
development processes fundamentally requires an understanding that \
programming, or more accurately, software development, is a process of study \
and creative search rather than production and design. In software \
development, concepts from conventional engineering disciplines are \
inapplicable. Leading scholars in our profession have spent more than 30 \
years documenting and analyzing the issues that emerge. For instance, in the \

model.This is essentially a technique for architectural positioning. The BMW \
X6 is an illustration of a novel idea that merges the attributes of a coupe \
and an SUV; BMW refers to this combination as the sportsactivity coupe. BMW \

implementation. (And almost all web and business apps fall under the \
\"integrated\" category!) The classic \"Big Bang\" deployment involves \
bringing a large number of beams into the desert, launching them into the \
air, and then waiting for the beams to self-assemble into a building.\n\nOne \
component should be planned instead. When starting from scratch or replacing \
an existing system, there are two major benefits to this method.\n\nFirst, we \
enter the area of cumulative technical risk embedded in the program code when \
we release a software product.By deploying components one after the other, \
this technical risk is spread out across a longer time frame.Since each \
component has a unique probability of malfunctioning when used, we are able \
to design each one separately.\n\n \n\nSecond, sequential deployment makes it \
necessary for us to design distinct component interfaces. Reintegrating a new \
system's component with the old system is common when one of its components \
is deployed. Each component will thus have time to work with both the \
original and the replacement systems by the time the deployment is \
finished.Thus, component-by-component deployment naturally enhances the \
capacity for component reuse. In actuality, this also results in less \
coupling and more coherence.\n\nOn the other hand, the comparison falls short \
in several significant ways. Specifically, the materiality of the real world \
highlights the importance of early planning and compels us to employ the \
waterfall method. After all, no one ever begins to construct a skyscraper \
without having a clear idea of how much area and stories it will require. We \
attempt to avoid taking such drastic measures because adding floors to an \
existing building is too costly and dangerous. It is no longer appropriate to \
alter the once-designed skyscraper's location or height. The towers cannot be \
scaled.\n\nAlthough adding new tracks to the road is difficult, we can \
quickly add new features to the program. It is the dignity of the workplace; \
it is not a flaw in the development process. Nothing stops us from publishing \
a minimally functional app if people are willing to pay for these \
functionalities. In actuality, the outcome's net value increases with the \
sooner you deliver your application.\n\nAlthough the gradual deployment \
strategy and the early release seem at odds at first, they work incredibly \
well together. It is possible for each component to go through iterative \
development independently of the others when individual components are \
released early.Additionally, using this method will compel you to address \
problems like protocol version control and continuous availability during \
deployment.\n\nIt is uncommon to find methods that offer both better \
architectural traits and a larger commercial value, yet early component \
deployment has both benefits."],

to be a practitioner; hence, a competent architect must possess a minimum of \
one expert-level professional tool, such as an integrated design environment \
(IDE). It makes logical that the software architect should be acquainted with \
the IDE, the information architect with XML modeling tools, and the database \
architect with the set of tools required to construct entity-relation charts \
(ER-charts).Nonetheless, the lead architect is not restricted to any level of \
tool application proficiency; he must be adept at all levels. Instances of \
this include simulating complex financial transactions with XMLSpy and \
monitoring network traffic with Wireshark.\n\nEven if it is usually simple to \
wow the management and technical team, he is unlikely to gain the respect of \
the group if he is unable to show off his skills in an actual work \
environment. In such a situation, it will be challenging for the team to \
train new members, and it is unlikely that they will be able to complete the \
work for which they were hired."],

wide range of different problems, there isn't a single, comprehensive \
solution, so the architect must continuously refine and improve his \"context \
noe poche.\" Eberhardt Rechtin writes in \"Systems Architecting: Creating and \
Building Complex Systems\" (Prentice Hall, 1991):\n\n <...> Rather than using \
the word \"sensual,\" it might be better to speak to it as \"context \
sensation\"\[LongDash]knowledge of what is pertinent in a certain context. By \
the time an architect-practitioner is called to address a system-level issue, \
which usually takes decades, they can have a strong contextual awareness \
thanks to education, experience, and case studies. \n\nOne of the biggest \
problems I see with the software industry, in my opinion, is that projects \
are often given to people who don't have enough contextual knowledge.This \
could be due to the fact that the industry is only two generations old and is \
currently experiencing a time of rapid expansion; alternatively, it could be \
that the industry has reached a mature stage if this problem has been \
resolved.\n\nI deal with this issue on a regular basis in my consulting \
practice, in all its manifestations. Here are a few examples of typical ones: \
Rejecting domain-driven design when it makes sense; being unduly excited \
about the creation of a software solution for a task that doesn't require any \
delay; and suggesting ridiculous or useless ideas when attempts to optimize \
the performance of the system are stalled.\n\nKnowing when to use and when \
not to utilize program templates is essential to comprehending them.This also \
applies to theories on what the root causes of the problem are and how best \
to solve it. When designing the architecture of the system or analyzing the \
issue, an architect must develop his contextual sense, formulate \
architectural solutions, and identify and eliminate any flaws in those \
solutions because there is, by definition, no universal solution \"for all \
