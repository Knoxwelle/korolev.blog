        When it comes to developing a software architecture, we first imagine the classic technical operations: system breakdown into modules, defining interfaces, allocating responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance.In addition, the architect must take into account a number of other aspects, including safety, ease of use, easy maintenance, output management, choice of deployment settings, etc.However, all of these technical and procedural aspects must be relevant to the needs of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account in the analysis of requirements is a great way to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are complete.
All parties involved in the project have interests affecting both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole. It is the analysis of these interests that forms the resulting set of priorities for the architect.

        I&rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we are talking about DevOps and SRE in enterprise companies and their recruitment processes.
DevOps/SRE I was unemployed and full of time, so I decided to interview DevOps. In vain that the course on Linux was held on Udemy (a joke, sarcasm, still passed, but to write about it is embarrassing)?! And then I liked the process much more. It consisted of only two steps: general knowledge and troubleshooting.
In general, the interviewer had a list of questions, but he allowed himself to deviate a little from it, which gave some liveliness to the conversation. We&rsquo;ve had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, container operation, and databases. In general, what happens in the universe one way or another?

        Time is approaching evening.The command is friendly about the new functionality scheduled for the current iteration; it seems that even the air in the room is pulsing at a working pace.However, John is a little in a hurry: he is waiting for a date.However, he has time to rewrite his part of the code, compiles it, registers in the source code management system – and rushes away.A few minutes later, the &ldquo;red light&rdquo; is lit: the assembly of the app is disrupted.John didn&rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he acted on the rush and run principle, causing the entire team to stall.
The situation has changed – the working rhythm has failed. Now everyone knows that when you update the code from the version control system, the code will not work on their local computers, and because the team will have to integrate a lot of code to prepare for the upcoming demonstration, this becomes a serious obstacle.

        The performance of an application is determined by its architecture. At first glance, this assertion seems obvious, but real-life experience shows the opposite. For example, software architects often believe that application performance problems can be solved by simply switching to the software infrastructure from another manufacturer. The source of this belief may be a river of noise around the test results; for example, it is stated that the product of the leading company is 25% superior in performance to the nearest competitor. However, if the leader product performs the operation in 3 milliseconds and the competitor product in 4 milliseconds, the stated 25% (one millisection) means very little against the background of the overall low performance, which is rooted in architecture inefficiency. In addition to IT managers and performance testing teams, there are other groups of people, such as the developer&rsquo;s support service and the authors of the app performance management books, who recommend that you do the subtle configuration of the application&rsquo;s infrastructure: play with memory allocation operations, connectivity pool sizes, flow pool size, and so on.

        Equipment is vulnerable to damage, so we&rsquo;re introducing excess in our systems.It allows you to survive individual hardware failures, but increases the likelihood that at any time at least one malfunction will be present in the system.
The software code is also vulnerable. Our applications are based on software code, which means they are vulnerable too.We implement monitoring tools that report application failures, but these tools are also based on software code, which means that they are vulnerable to failure themselves.
So people make mistakes, so we try to automate our actions, diagnostics and workflows.Automation reduces the likelihood of errors caused by breaches of rules, but increases the likeliness of mistakes resulting from lack of rules.No automated system is capable of responding to such a range of situations as a human being.

        Essential complexity is a problem inherent in any task. For example, the task of coordinating air traffic at the national level is complex in itself. The control system must monitor in real time the precise location of each aircraft (including altitude), its speed, direction and destination, in order to prevent collisions in the air and on the runways. It is also necessary to manage flight schedules promptly to avoid congestion at airports in constantly changing conditions – when the weather changes sharply the entire schedule has to be revised.
On the other hand, accidental complexity is caused by challenges that we think need to be solved in order to reduce the inherent complexity. An example of a minor complexity is the outdated flight management system still in use.

        We have all fallen into “budget” refinements, when smart technological solutions are “buried” for savings.The conversation goes like this:
“Do we really need X?” the project sponsor asks.
In place of X you can replace virtually everything vital to the system: software licenses, surplus servers, external backups or power sources. The question is always asked in a native tone, as if you are dropping all your pocket money on comics and chewing, while serious adults need to think about buying new shells, in which they will drag their future profits.
The correct answer to this question is, &ldquo;Yes. Absolutely necessary.&rdquo; But for some reason, almost no one answers.
After all, we have technical education, and any technical discipline is the art of compromise.It is clear that no one will need exotic power sources if you put several white wheels in the data center and start interns in them.

        I&rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time it is about testing knowledge in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.
Knowledge test So, I talked about five stages of IT interviews. You probably thought I exaggerated. But no: recruiter, Python test, live coding, system design, soft skills. Then another call for the offer presentation. So, the second stage is just some kind of Facebook spam. Not only can it be combined with live coding if it is not just to code but to discuss the solution, but also the questions on it, softly speaking, are stupid. Primitive and old-fashioned. So, according to the company&rsquo;s logic, you can send soaps there, so you don&rsquo;t waste your gentlemen&rsquo;s time.

        I&rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about system design enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.
System Design In senior grades, another type of interview appears—system design. In one hour you have to design systems, thinking about the architecture of which in a real project you would spend several weeks. IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, BPMN—forget these scary words; there&rsquo;s no time for them. Figac-figac and Proudakshen. Requirements collection -&gt; usage options -&gt; system requirements -&gt; processing -&gt; presentation of the solution, time has passed. The main thing here is more basic words: to build a smart face and somewhere to put kafka. Then they&rsquo;ll be behind you in 40 minutes.

        For many of us, an architect&rsquo;s career began with some sort of purely technical position, where success was largely determined by the ability to communicate with computers.But as an architect, we have to communicate mainly with other people. Whether you are discussing the advantages of a template with developers or explaining to management the pros and cons of buying intermediate software, your communication skills are the key to success.
Objectively measure the degree of influence of the architect on the project is quite difficult, but one thing is quite clear: if the developers constantly ignore the instructions of the Architect, and the management does not attach importance to his recommendations, the &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of the actions of architect will not affect the development of his career.
