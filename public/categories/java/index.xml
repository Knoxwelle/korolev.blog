      <description>Another salary calculation project is currently failing horribly somewhere; it&amp;rsquo;s probably not your fault.&#xA;Why did that happen? because Ruby was chosen by the developers instead of Smalltalk, Java, or Python? since you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you are aware, project failures are often attributed to technology.&#xA;Projects are typically started by people, and it is up to these people to determine whether the initiative succeeds or fails overall. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we should think about the ways we might help them succeed.&#xA;As a result, you think that one of the team members is performing poorly and preventing the project from moving forward.</description>
