      <description>The architect must continuously refine and improve his &amp;ldquo;context noe poche&amp;rdquo;, since there is no single universal solution for a wide range of diverse problems.Eberhardt Rechtin, in his book &amp;ldquo;Systems Architecting: Creating &amp;amp; Building Complex Systems&amp;rdquo; (Prentice Hall, 1991):&#xA;“To learn the basic principles of the “eristic approach” to the design of complex systems, ask an experienced architect what he does when faced with a difficult task.His answer would most likely be, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just using common sense.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;&amp;hellip;&amp;gt;Instead of the term “sensual” it would be better to use the expression “context sensation”1 – knowledge of what is ra zoom in a given context.Education, experience and study of examples allow the architect-practitioner to acquire a considerable power of contextual sense by the moment when it is entrusted to solve a system-level problem – usually it takes decades.</description>
