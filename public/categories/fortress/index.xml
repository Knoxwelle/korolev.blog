      <description>In the database datax is stored all information – both entered by employees and received from customers. User interfaces, business logic, and applied logic (and even employees) come and go, and data stays.It is difficult to describe in words how important it is to build a reliable data model in the early days of the project.&#xA;The enormous popularity of flexible design methodologies has led many to think that applications can (and even preferably!) be designed in the course of work.The era of pre-writing complex, exhaustive technical specifications is gone forever! The new school calls for the product to be delivered early and frequently.One line of exploitable code is better than 10 lines in your head.Sounds too good to be true&amp;hellip; at least as far as data is concerned.</description>
