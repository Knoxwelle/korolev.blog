      <description>An architecture cannot accomplish high security, high availability, high abstraction, and high performance all at once. All that software architects need to do is know, understand, and relate one real narrative to their peers and clients. I am speaking of Vaza&amp;rsquo;s history.&#xA;In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. An attempt was made to bring this expensive war to an early end by the Swedish King by ordering the construction of a galleon known as the vase. The ship was not like the others. It was unlike any other ship of the time in its features. It had to be longer than sixty meters in order to safely convey 300 men at a time to Poland while also carrying 64 weapons on two battery decks.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself (DRY)&amp;rdquo; is probably one of the most important principles of programming, and it underlies many other well-known correct approaches and design patterns in software development. A developer who has learned to recognize duplication and can eliminate it using appropriate techniques and suitable abstraction is capable of writing much clearer code than one who constantly clutters the application with unnecessary repetitions.&#xA;Code duplication is ballast Every line of application code requires maintenance, and it serves as a source of potential errors in the future. Duplication leads to unnecessary increased code volume, which raises the likelihood of errors and makes the system overly complex. Increased system volume due to duplication, firstly, it prevents developers from fully understanding the system, and secondly, it does not guarantee that changes made in one place do not It will be necessary to repeat it in other places where this logic is duplicated.</description>

      <description>In the 1980s, the programming environment, as a rule, did not differ much from an advanced text editor â€“ at best. Today, we take syntax highlighting for granted, but back then it was a luxury not available to everyone. Code formatting tools existed as external tools, the use of which corrected spacing. Debuggers also &amp;ldquo;lived&amp;rdquo; separately as programs for step-by-step code execution, and working with them required knowing a multitude of mysterious key combinations.&#xA;In the 1990s, companies began to realize the profit potential of more convenient and useful development tools. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) combined previously offered editing features with a compiler, debugger, formatting tools, and other instruments. At that time, menus and mice became popular, which meant that developers no longer needed to memorize complex key combinations to work with their editor.</description>
