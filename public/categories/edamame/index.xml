      <description>Recently, I was at the grocery store and searched for edamame, green soybeans (I only vaguely guessed they were some kind of vegetable). I didn&amp;rsquo;t I knew where to look for this product: in the vegetable section, in the frozen section. products or on the shelves with canned goods? Finally, I gave up and asked a store employee for help. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know either!&#xA;The store employee could have reacted to my request in different ways. She could have made it clear that only a fool doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where to look for it, or just brushed it off. vague hints, or even just say that they don&amp;rsquo;t have such a product. But she deemed it possible to find a solution and help the customer.</description>
