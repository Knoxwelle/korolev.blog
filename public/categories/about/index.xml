      <description>Hi, I am Stan,&#xA;I was born in Sochi, but since 2018 I have been living in Vancouver, British Columbia. Who am I?&#xA;Software Developer with expertise in all aspects of enterprise-grade commercial architecture standards.Â Software Automation expert responsible for delivering software quality via regression in CI/CD pipeline, directing teams for performance. AWS certified. Ph.D.&#xA;I have experience in the information and telecommunication technology industry for more than 17 years. Throughout my career, I have built a number of large-scale, cross-country software systems; most of them are still running in production.&#xA;Once a month, I go somewhere. Not for work, but because I love traveling. I write rather superficially and briefly, depending on my mood. Even though I fly a lot on airplanes, I will not write here about how to choose a seat on a plane, accumulate miles, or transfer to business class.</description>
