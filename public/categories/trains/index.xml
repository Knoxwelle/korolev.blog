      <description>re still forced to participate in such a project? It will be better for you and everyone else if you choose technology for the benefit of the customer rather than your resume. Sometimes it is difficult to resist the temptation to apply a new fashionable solution, even if it does not fit the current situation. With the right solution you get a satisfied team and satisfied customer, and the overall stress of work on the project is significantly reduced. Often this allows you to study a already familiar technology in depth or engage in the development of novelty in your spare time. Or maybe you even have free time to attend the painting courses you have always dreamed of. Your loved ones will appreciate it too – they will notice the difference in your condition when you come home after work.</description>
