      <description>At my first programming class at the university, the instructor handed out two sheets for us to write the program text in BASIC. On the board, he wrote the assignment: &amp;ldquo;Create a program to input and calculate the average of 10 bowling scores.&amp;rdquo; Then the teacher left the room. Is this task difficult? I don&amp;rsquo;t remember my solution, but it seems there was a FOR/NEXT loop and no more than 15 lines of code.&#xA;In each form for the program code, we would write the code by hand before entering it into the computer â€“ it was about 70 lines. I had no idea why the teacher gave us two forms each. Since my handwriting has always been terrible, I used the second form to neatly rewrite my code, hoping to earn a couple of points for style.</description>
