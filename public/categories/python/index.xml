      <description>Another salary calculation project is currently failing horribly somewhere; it&amp;rsquo;s probably not your fault.&#xA;Why did that happen? because Ruby was chosen by the developers instead of Smalltalk, Java, or Python? since you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you are aware, project failures are often attributed to technology.&#xA;Projects are typically started by people, and it is up to these people to determine whether the initiative succeeds or fails overall. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we should think about the ways we might help them succeed.&#xA;As a result, you think that one of the team members is performing poorly and preventing the project from moving forward.</description>

      <description>I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.&#xA;Examining Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:&#xA;-How is it possible to halt the container? The original data types in Python? What is the PID of the Linux kernel? How are PACELC and CAP understood?&#xA;-&amp;hellip; Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; Or even &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it in a review.</description>
