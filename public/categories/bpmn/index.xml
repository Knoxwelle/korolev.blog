      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about system design enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;System Design In senior grades, another type of interview appears—system design. In one hour you have to design systems, thinking about the architecture of which in a real project you would spend several weeks. IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, BPMN—forget these scary words; there&amp;rsquo;s no time for them. Figac-figac and Proudakshen. Requirements collection -&amp;gt; usage options -&amp;gt; system requirements -&amp;gt; processing -&amp;gt; presentation of the solution, time has passed. The main thing here is more basic words: to build a smart face and somewhere to put kafka. Then they&amp;rsquo;ll be behind you in 40 minutes.</description>
