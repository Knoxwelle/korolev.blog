I was born in Sochi, but since 2018 I have been living in Vancouver, British Columbia. Who am I?
Software Developer with expertise in all aspects of enterprise-grade commercial architecture standards. Software Automation expert responsible for delivering software quality via regression in CI/CD pipeline, directing teams for performance. AWS certified. Ph.D.
I have experience in the information and telecommunication technology industry for more than 17 years. Throughout my career, I have built a number of large-scale, cross-country software systems; most of them are still running in production.
Once a month, I go somewhere. Not for work, but because I love traveling. I write rather superficially and briefly, depending on my mood. Even though I fly a lot on airplanes, I will not write here about how to choose a seat on a plane, accumulate miles, or transfer to business class.">

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Stan,</p>
<p>I was born in Sochi, but since 2018 I have been living in Vancouver, British Columbia. Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>Software Developer</strong> with expertise in all aspects of enterprise-grade commercial architecture standards. <strong>Software Automation</strong> expert responsible for delivering software quality via regression in CI/CD pipeline, directing teams for performance. AWS certified. Ph.D.</p>
<p>I have experience in the information and telecommunication technology industry for more than 17 years. Throughout my career, I have built a number of large-scale, cross-country software systems; most of them are still running in production.</p>
<p>Once a month, I go somewhere. Not for work, but because I love traveling. I write rather superficially and briefly, depending on my mood. Even though I fly a lot on airplanes, I will not write here about how to choose a seat on a plane, accumulate miles, or transfer to business class. I’ll leave this antimony to other penmen. What I will definitely write about is a career in IT and the problems of relationships with technology, code, and working processes in development. I&rsquo;m going to lose and find myself in meaningless notes about life, attempts to get to know Zen, and thousands of ways to reach the summit of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>If you like what I write about, email me <a href="mailto:korolevst@gmail.com">korolevst@gmail.com</a>. I’m always interested to know how people find this blog.</p>
