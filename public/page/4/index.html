        If your application needs to handle a large, long-lived set of interrelated data elements, you can confidently place it in a relational database. In the past, there were few relational DBMSs; they were complex, expensive to maintain, and clunky beasts. Those times are gone. Today, finding a relational DBMS is not difficult: it is quite possible that a relational DBMS or even two are already installed on your machine. Some very advanced relational DBMSs, such like MySQL and PostgreSQL, are available in source code, so the question of costs it is no longer worth buying them. Moreover, the so-called &ldquo;embedded database systems&rdquo; can be integrated into your application as libraries, almost requiring no configuration and administration; two such examples are interesting open-source DBMS, SQLite and HSQLDB.

        Everyone who has worked in our industry has surely encountered a project, code which caused concern. The parts of such a system are highly interconnected, and for some reason, changing the code of one function leads to the complete failure of the system. another. When adding a new module, one has to limit changes to a minimum and hold their breath, waiting for the consequences. It&rsquo;s like playing Jenga with the floors of a skyscraper – it inevitably leads to disaster.
Making changes is so nerve-wracking only because the system is sick. It needs treatment, otherwise its condition will only worsen. You know the flaws in the system, but you are afraid to take decisive action. An experienced surgeon knows that it is necessary to make incisions to perform the surgery, but he also knows that the incisions are temporary and will heal afterward.

        In systems theory, there is the concept of isolation, which is among the most useful when it comes to large and complex system structures. In the software development industry, everyone understands the value of isolating one entity within another, in other words, encapsulation. In programming languages, subprograms and functions, modules and packages, classes, etc., are used to ensure isolation.
Modules and packages solve large-scale encapsulation tasks, while how classes, subprograms, and functions are designed to solve the same problems in a more at a low level. Over the years of working, I have discovered that of all types of encapsulation The most difficult thing for programmers is encapsulation in classes. It is not uncommon to encounter a class where the only method, main, has 5000 lines, or a class, in which there are only set and get methods for its basic attributes.

        In general, what is business analytics? If we break down this phrase word by word, it is the analysis of business requirements. It is not design, it is not programming, it is specifically the analysis of requirements. The main task is to help the client understand what they actually need. However, clients and end users often present what they think are effective solutions to a problem as requirements. In other words, they believe they have already found all the solutions and want them implemented. The effectiveness of this is quite questionable, as it leads to project overload with requirements, which often contradict each other, and significantly increases its cost. In exceptional cases, the project becomes completely unfeasible.
A classic example of this kind is provided by Harry Hillaker, the chief designer of the F-16 Falcon fighter jet.

        I have yet to meet a client who wouldn&rsquo;t be happy to tell me what they need – usually down to the smallest details. The problem is that clients don&rsquo;t always tell the whole truth. Overall, clients don&rsquo;t lie, but they speak in their own client language, not in the language of developers. They have their own vocabulary and their own context. They leave out important details. They talk as if you have also worked in their company for twenty years. And it is all complicated by the fact that, in reality, clients often don&rsquo;t know what they need! Some have an understanding of the big picture, but they are rarely able to articulate their vision clearly. For others, the overall picture may be less vivid, but they know what they don&rsquo;t need.

        Match the interests of the parties with the technical requirements. When it comes to software architecture development, First and foremost, we envision classic technical operations: breaking the system into modules, defining interfaces, distributing responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance. In addition, the architect must consider a number of other aspects, including issues of security, ease of use, maintainability, release management, deployment parameter selection, etc. But all the listed technical and procedural aspects must be aligned with the needs of stakeholders. Taking these interests into account when analyzing requirements is an excellent way to ensure the completeness of the specifications for the requirements of the product being developed.
All parties involved in the project have interests that affect both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole.

        There are several reasons why a software project might not succeed. One of the most common reasons projects fail is modifying the work schedule in the middle of the project without adequate planning. These kinds of failures can be avoided, but it will require a large team effort to do so. Changes to a project&rsquo;s schedule or resource allocation usually don&rsquo;t result in any problems. Problems occur when you have to work longer hours in the same amount of time or shorten the schedule without reducing the task.
The myth that you may shorten the schedule to save costs or speed product delivery is one that is widely held. More hours are typically put in, or &ldquo;less important tasks&rdquo; (such as modular testing) are abandoned in order to produce a product faster or with better functionality that doesn&rsquo;t delay delivery.
