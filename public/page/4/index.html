        We architects are interested in learning how good the software we are developing is.There is a more subtle internal component to program quality that has to do with the design&rsquo;s clarity, or how simple it is for us to comprehend, support, and grow the software product. The exterior component of program quality is evident: the program must be valuable to the user. Whenever we push for a definition of quality, we ultimately say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know when I see it.&rdquo; So, what do you think quality is?
Architectural charts use small squares to represent entire systems, and the lines that connect them can indicate any number of things, including shared resources (like a train) or dependencies. These diagrams show the system at a 10-kilometer altitude, which is roughly equivalent to how an airplane views the terrain.

        Everyone who has worked in our industry has surely encountered a project, code which caused concern. The parts of such a system are highly interconnected, and for some reason, changing the code of one function leads to the complete failure of the system. another. When adding a new module, one has to limit changes to a minimum and hold their breath, waiting for the consequences. It&rsquo;s like playing Jenga with the floors of a skyscraper – it inevitably leads to disaster.
Making changes is so nerve-wracking only because the system is sick. It needs treatment, otherwise its condition will only worsen. You know the flaws in the system, but you are afraid to take decisive action. An experienced surgeon knows that it is necessary to make incisions to perform the surgery, but he also knows that the incisions are temporary and will heal afterward.

        No matter what you call them – bugs, defects, or even design side effects – it is impossible to eliminate them completely. For a project to be successful moving forward, it is very important to be able to correctly write an error report, as well as to know what to pay attention to in it.
In a good bug report, three things should be described: • How to reproduce the error – as accurately as possible – and how often the error manifests itself. • What was supposed to happen – how do you see it? • What is actually happening – at least the data you were able to record.
The volume and quality of the provided information equally characterize the report&rsquo;s author, as well as the error itself.

        You don&rsquo;t need to be Sherlock Holmes to understand that good programmers write good code. Well, the bad ones don&rsquo;t. They create ugly things that everyone else has to clean up. But you want to write good code, right? Then you need to strive to become a good programmer.
Good code doesn&rsquo;t just appear out of nowhere. Its emergence is not caused by the favorable alignment of the planets. To make the code good, you need to work on it, and quite a bit. You will create good code only when you truly strive for it. Good programming is not the result of mere technical competence. I have encountered very smart programmers who are capable of creating strong and impressive algorithms, know the standards of their language perfectly, and yet write completely terrible code.

        You can ask 100 different people what any programmer should know and be able to do, and get 100 different answers. This can be both overwhelming and frightening. All advice is good, all principles are sound, all stories are convincing, but where to start? And, more importantly, once you start applying best practices, how do you maintain the right level and make them an integral part of your programming practice?
I think the answer lies in your mindset or simply in your approach. If you are indifferent to your fellow developers, testers, managers, sales and marketing staff, as well as end users, you will not feel the urge to, for example, conduct test-driven development or write clear comments in the code. I think there is a simple way to change your attitude and develop a desire to release products of the highest quality:

        It&rsquo;s getting close to evening. The team is diligently working on the new functionality planned for the current iteration; it seems even the air in the room is pulsing with the rhythm of work. However, John is a bit in a hurry: he has a date waiting for him. However, he manages to finish writing his part of the code, compiles it, registers it in the version control system – and hastily leaves. A few minutes later, the &ldquo;red light&rdquo; comes on: the application build is broken. John didn&rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he went with the &ldquo;hack and run&rdquo; principle, which caused the entire team&rsquo;s work to come to a halt.
The situation has changed – the work rhythm has been disrupted.

        The performance of an application is determined by its architecture. At first glance, it seems that this statement should be obvious, but real-world experience shows otherwise. For example, software architects often believe that application performance issues can be resolved simply by switching to software infrastructure from another vendor. The source of this belief may be the advertising hype surrounding testing results – for example, it is claimed that the leading company&rsquo;s product outperforms the nearest competitor by a certain percentage. However, if the leading product performs an operation in 3 milliseconds, while the competing product does it in 4 milliseconds, the claimed percentage (one millisecond) means very little against the backdrop of overall low performance rooted in architectural inefficiency.
Besides IT managers and performance testing teams, there are and other groups of people, such as the support service of the development company and authors of books on application performance management, which they recommend fine-tuning the application infrastructure: play with memory allocation operations, connection pool sizes, the sizes of thread pools and so on.
