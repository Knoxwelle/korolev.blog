        In general, what is business analytics? If we break down this phrase word by word, it is the analysis of business requirements. It is not design, it is not programming, it is specifically the analysis of requirements. The main task is to help the client understand what they actually need. However, clients and end users often present what they think are effective solutions to a problem as requirements. In other words, they believe they have already found all the solutions and want them implemented. The effectiveness of this is quite questionable, as it leads to project overload with requirements, which often contradict each other, and significantly increases its cost. In exceptional cases, the project becomes completely unfeasible.
A classic example of this kind is provided by Harry Hillaker, the chief designer of the F-16 Falcon fighter jet.

        &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; cannot be a requirement. Nor can &ldquo;having a good response time.&rdquo; Or, let&rsquo;s say, &ldquo;scalable.&rdquo; The main reason is the lack of objective criteria for meeting such requirements. But users still need these characteristics. The architect&rsquo;s task is to ensure that the system possesses the necessary qualities and to balance the inevitable contradictions that arise. between them. Without objective criteria, the architect depends on whims the client (&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t accept the program – it doesn&rsquo;t work fast enough&rdquo;) and the developers, obsessed with their compulsions (&ldquo;No, the program isn&rsquo;t ready yet – it doesn&rsquo;t work fast enough&rdquo;).
Usually, we try to record all such requests, just like any other requirements. But this record often looks like a set of vague epithets: &ldquo;flexible,&rdquo; &ldquo;easy to accompany,&rdquo; and so on.

        As a rule, the programs you write at work do not satisfy your most ambitious programmer dreams. It may happen that you are developing software for a huge insurance company, but you would like to work at Google, Apple, Microsoft, or start your own startup that will bring about the next revolution. You will never reach your goal by developing software for systems that do not interest you.
Fortunately, there is a solution to your problem: open source, that is, projects with open source code. In the world, there are thousands of open-source projects, and many of them are quite active, where a programmer can gain any experience their heart desires. If you are drawn to the idea of developing an operating system systems, choose one of the ten available operating system projects for yourself.

        Nearly all architects begin their professional lives as developers. Although the architect has more duties, he also has more say over how the system is designed. It will be hard for you to give up some of your programming habits in your new work as an architect. Even worse, you might think that in order to put your concept into practice, you have to keep an eye on the developers and everything they do. But it&rsquo;s critical for your success—as well as the success of your team—to provide each of your coworkers with enough autonomy to showcase their abilities and originality.
It is rare for a developer to have time to sit down and consider the overall coherence of the system. The architect should give this their whole attention at the same time.

        Very often we program in isolation, and our programs reflect both our personal interpretation of the problem and a very personal solution to it. We can work in a team, but even then we are isolated as a team. We easily forget that the code created in such isolation will be executed, used, and extended by other people. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook the social aspect of programming. Creating software is both a technical and a social endeavor. We should look around more often to understand that we do not work in isolation and that we share a common responsibility for the potential success not only of the group of developers but also of every person around us.
It is possible to write high-quality code in isolation from reality, completely detached.

        When I encounter a system that has been in development or operation for a long time, the first sign of real trouble is always a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; log. You know what I&rsquo;m talking about: it&rsquo;s when clicking a link during normal web page usage results in a whole stream of messages being recorded in the system&rsquo;s single log. Too many log entries can be just as useless as having none at all.
If your systems are similar to mine, then when your work ends, the work of others begins. After the development is completed, the system will be long and successfully serve customers (if you&rsquo;re lucky). How will you learn about problems if the system is in operation, and what will you do about them?

        Have you encountered projects where reasonable technological solutions are &ldquo;buried&rdquo; for the sake of saving costs?
The conversation goes something like this: &ldquo;Do we really need X?&rdquo; asks the project manager. You can substitute X with almost anything essential for system operations: software product licenses, redundant servers, external backups or power sources. The question is always asked in a fatherly tone, as if you were spending all your pocket money on comics and chewing gum, while serious adults need to think about buying new buckets in which they will carry their future profits.
The correct answer to this question is: &ldquo;Yes. Absolutely necessary.&rdquo; But for some reason, almost no one responds.
After all, we have a technical education, and any technical discipline is an art of compromise.

        Match the interests of the parties with the technical requirements. When it comes to software architecture development, First and foremost, we envision classic technical operations: breaking the system into modules, defining interfaces, distributing responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance. In addition, the architect must consider a number of other aspects, including issues of security, ease of use, maintainability, release management, deployment parameter selection, etc. But all the listed technical and procedural aspects must be aligned with the needs of stakeholders. Taking these interests into account when analyzing requirements is an excellent way to ensure the completeness of the specifications for the requirements of the product being developed.
All parties involved in the project have interests that affect both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole.

        You cover all the finished code or its fragments with automated tests. Congratulations! Do you write tests first and then code? Even better! Just because of this, you can be considered a programmer practicing advanced approaches in software development. But are your tests good? How can you determine that? One way is to ask yourself: &ldquo;Who am I writing for?&rdquo; these tests?». If the answer is &ldquo;I write them for myself to reduce costs for debugging&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the compiler to execute them,&rdquo; then it&rsquo;s quite possible that you are not writing the best tests. So, for whom Why write tests? For those who will try to understand your code.
Good tests serve as documentation for the code they are testing. They describe how the code works.

        The needs of business application users manifest primarily in the functional requirements. Non-functional aspects of the system (such as performance, flexibility, uptime, support needs, etc.) are the responsibility of the architect. When this preliminary testing of non-functional requirements is often postponed until a very late stage of the development cycle, and sometimes fully delegated to the team servicing the system.
This error occurs much more often than it should. At its core, it can there are various reasons. Concern for the speed and flexibility of a program that still doesn&rsquo;t properly perform the required function may seem pointless. The test environments and the tests themselves are quite complex. It&rsquo;s possible that early working versions of the system won&rsquo;t be subjected to realistic loads. due to insufficient use.
