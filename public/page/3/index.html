        As a rule, the programs you write at work do not satisfy your most ambitious programmer dreams. It may happen that you are developing software for a huge insurance company, but you would like to work at Google, Apple, Microsoft, or start your own startup that will bring about the next revolution. You will never reach your goal by developing software for systems that do not interest you.
Fortunately, there is a solution to your problem: open source, that is, projects with open source code. In the world, there are thousands of open-source projects, and many of them are quite active, where a programmer can gain any experience their heart desires. If you are drawn to the idea of developing an operating system systems, choose one of the ten available operating system projects for yourself.

        Many choices must be taken during the attachment-forming process. Some may be related to the library or infrastructure selection, while others may be related to the application of particular design patterns.In any event, the architect is often in charge of making the choice. The architect gathers all available data, considers it for a period, and then specifies the guidelines that the developers must follow. The fact that there is an improved method won&rsquo;t surprise you.
The decision-making process is described by Mary and Tom Poppendieck in their work on lean development. They think that the ultimate choice should wait until the most crucial moment, when the team&rsquo;s inaction will have permanent (or difficult to reverse) repercussions and a decision will be made on its behalf if no decision is made.

        Each of us has had something like this happen at some point. Your code has been uploaded to the staging server for system testing, and the department head Testing informs you that there is a problem. You are immediately ready to respond: &ldquo;Let me quickly fix everything: I know what the issue is.&rdquo;
However, in a broader sense, the problem is that you, as a developer, believe you should be granted access to the server where testing is being conducted.
In most cases, when it comes to web development, the architecture can be broken down into the following parts:
-Local development and unit testing on the developer&rsquo;s machine
Development server where automated or manual integration testing is conducted Staging server, where the quality control team and users conduct acceptance testing Combat (production) server Yes, there are other servers and services, for example, for managing source code or software defects, but the idea is clear.

        When testers and programmers start collaborating, miracles happen. Less time is spent playing ping-pong with defects in the defect tracking system. Less time is spent discussing whether the behavior is a bug or a new feature, and more time is spent on developing quality. software that meets customer expectations. There is many opportunities to establish collaboration even before the coding begins.
Testers can help clients write acceptance tests in the language their subject area using tools such as Fit (Framework for Интеграционный тест). If these tests are given to the programmers before they start writing code, they will be able to apply the practice of acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Programmers write frameworks to run the tests, and then code to ensure they pass. these tests.

        Very often we program in isolation, and our programs reflect both our personal interpretation of the problem and a very personal solution to it. We can work in a team, but even then we are isolated as a team. We easily forget that the code created in such isolation will be executed, used, and extended by other people. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook the social aspect of programming. Creating software is both a technical and a social endeavor. We should look around more often to understand that we do not work in isolation and that we share a common responsibility for the potential success not only of the group of developers but also of every person around us.
It is possible to write high-quality code in isolation from reality, completely detached.

        No matter what you call them – bugs, defects, or even design side effects – it is impossible to eliminate them completely. For a project to be successful moving forward, it is very important to be able to correctly write an error report, as well as to know what to pay attention to in it.
In a good bug report, three things should be described: • How to reproduce the error – as accurately as possible – and how often the error manifests itself. • What was supposed to happen – how do you see it? • What is actually happening – at least the data you were able to record.
The volume and quality of the provided information equally characterize the report&rsquo;s author, as well as the error itself.

        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself (DRY)&rdquo; is probably one of the most important principles of programming, and it underlies many other well-known correct approaches and design patterns in software development. A developer who has learned to recognize duplication and can eliminate it using appropriate techniques and suitable abstraction is capable of writing much clearer code than one who constantly clutters the application with unnecessary repetitions.
Code duplication is ballast Every line of application code requires maintenance, and it serves as a source of potential errors in the future. Duplication leads to unnecessary increased code volume, which raises the likelihood of errors and makes the system overly complex. Increased system volume due to duplication, firstly, it prevents developers from fully understanding the system, and secondly, it does not guarantee that changes made in one place do not It will be necessary to repeat it in other places where this logic is duplicated.

        An architecture cannot accomplish high security, high availability, high abstraction, and high performance all at once. All that software architects need to do is know, understand, and relate one real narrative to their peers and clients. I am speaking of Vaza&rsquo;s history.
In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. An attempt was made to bring this expensive war to an early end by the Swedish King by ordering the construction of a gallion known as the vase. The ship was not like the others. It was unlike any other ship of the time in its features. It had to be longer than sixty meters in order to safely convey 300 men at a time to Poland while also carrying 64 weapons on two battery decks.

        Code never lies, but it can be internally contradictory. Sometimes contradictions cause confusion: how can this even work?
In his interview, Allan Klumpp, the lead software developer for the Apollo lunar module, revealed that the engine control software contained a defect that caused the lunar module to behave erratically. However, there was another bug in the program that compensated for the first one, and during the Apollo 11 and 12 moon landings, this software was successfully used before the bugs were discovered and fixed.
Let&rsquo;s consider a function that returns an exit code. Let&rsquo;s say it returns false when it should return true. Now imagine that the calling function does not implement the check for the return value. Everything works perfectly until one day someone discovers the lack of a check and adds it.

        If you look at any activity, process, or discipline with sufficient long distance, everything seems simple. Managers who have no experience software development, believe that the work of a programmer is simple, and programmers who have no management experience feel the same way about the work of a manager.
Programming is a certain activity that some people spend some of their time on. And the most difficult part of the work—the thought process—is the least noticeable and the least appreciated by the uninitiated. For decades, attempts have been made to eliminate the need for skilled thinking personnel. One of the earliest and most memorable attempts was Grace Hopper&rsquo;s efforts to make programming languages less mysterious. Thanks to this, as some predicted, the need for narrowly specialized programmers may disappear.
