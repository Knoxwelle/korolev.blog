        &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; cannot be a requirement. Nor can &ldquo;having a good response time.&rdquo; Or, let&rsquo;s say, &ldquo;scalable.&rdquo; The main reason is the lack of objective criteria for meeting such requirements. But users still need these characteristics. The architect&rsquo;s task is to ensure that the system possesses the necessary qualities and to balance the inevitable contradictions that arise. between them. Without objective criteria, the architect depends on whims the client (&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t accept the program – it doesn&rsquo;t work fast enough&rdquo;) and the developers, obsessed with their compulsions (&ldquo;No, the program isn&rsquo;t ready yet – it doesn&rsquo;t work fast enough&rdquo;).
Usually, we try to record all such requests, just like any other requirements. But this record often looks like a set of vague epithets: &ldquo;flexible,&rdquo; &ldquo;easy to accompany,&rdquo; and so on.

        The needs of business application users manifest primarily in the functional requirements. Non-functional aspects of the system (such as performance, flexibility, uptime, support needs, etc.) are the responsibility of the architect. When this preliminary testing of non-functional requirements is often postponed until a very late stage of the development cycle, and sometimes fully delegated to the team servicing the system.
This error occurs much more often than it should. At its core, it can there are various reasons. Concern for the speed and flexibility of a program that still doesn&rsquo;t properly perform the required function may seem pointless. The test environments and the tests themselves are quite complex. It&rsquo;s possible that early working versions of the system won&rsquo;t be subjected to realistic loads. due to insufficient use.

        Seeing what has survived and what hasn&rsquo;t has long been one of my favorite vivid forms of amusement. There were a plethora of patterns, infrastructures, paradigm shifts, and algorithms. Wise people debated them fervently, considered long-term views, and attempted to strike a balance between all the known components, but in the end, they came to naught. Why? What is the past attempting to teach us?
Pick a noble assignment For a software architect, this is highly challenging. We receive assignments and issues from the client, so we really don&rsquo;t have a choice, do we? It&rsquo;s not really that easy. First of all, we frequently make the error of thinking that we have little power over what the customer desires. But it&rsquo;s typically possible to just step outside of your comfort zone when it comes to technology.

        Psychology in IT manifests in everything. Every person has their own base tendencies to dominate. Remember that famous experiment where a group of people was divided into prisoners and guards? Or India with its castes? Well, IT is just like India.
Too often, software architects dwell in ivory towers, sending down specifications to developers and imposing technologies and directions on them. This often leads to conflicts, which are quickly followed by a &ldquo;popular uprising.&rdquo; As a result, a software product emerges that has nothing to do with the original requirements. Every software architect should be able to explain the goals and objectives of the software project to their colleagues. The keys to effective communication are clarity and leadership.
Clarity characterizes the communication process. No one in your group will become read a 100-page document justifying your architectural decisions.

        For many of us, a career as an architect began with some purely technical position where success was primarily determined by the ability to communicate with computers. However, in the role of an architect, we primarily have to communicate with other people. Whether you discuss the advantages of a particular template with developers or explain to management the pros and cons of purchasing middleware, the key to success lies in your communication skills.
Objectively measuring the degree of an architect&rsquo;s influence on a project is quite difficult, but one thing is clear: if developers constantly ignore the architect&rsquo;s instructions and management does not pay attention to his recommendations, the &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of the architect&rsquo;s actions will not affect the development of his career in any way.

        You don&rsquo;t need to be Sherlock Holmes to understand that good programmers write good code. Well, the bad ones don&rsquo;t. They create ugly things that everyone else has to clean up. But you want to write good code, right? Then you need to strive to become a good programmer.
Good code doesn&rsquo;t just appear out of nowhere. Its emergence is not caused by the favorable alignment of the planets. To make the code good, you need to work on it, and quite a bit. You will create good code only when you truly strive for it. Good programming is not the result of mere technical competence. I have encountered very smart programmers who are capable of creating strong and impressive algorithms, know the standards of their language perfectly, and yet write completely terrible code.

        It&rsquo;s getting close to evening. The team is diligently working on the new functionality planned for the current iteration; it seems even the air in the room is pulsing with the rhythm of work. However, John is a bit in a hurry: he has a date waiting for him. However, he manages to finish writing his part of the code, compiles it, registers it in the version control system – and hastily leaves. A few minutes later, the &ldquo;red light&rdquo; comes on: the application build is broken. John didn&rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he went with the &ldquo;hack and run&rdquo; principle, which caused the entire team&rsquo;s work to come to a halt.
The situation has changed – the work rhythm has been disrupted.

        Nearly all architects begin their professional lives as developers. Although the architect has more duties, he also has more say over how the system is designed. It will be hard for you to give up some of your programming habits in your new work as an architect. Even worse, you might think that in order to put your concept into practice, you have to keep an eye on the developers and everything they do. But it&rsquo;s critical for your success—as well as the success of your team—to provide each of your coworkers with enough autonomy to showcase their abilities and originality.
It is rare for a developer to have time to sit down and consider the overall coherence of the system. The architect should give this their whole attention at the same time.

        You cover all the finished code or its fragments with automated tests. Congratulations! Do you write tests first and then code? Even better! Just because of this, you can be considered a programmer practicing advanced approaches in software development. But are your tests good? How can you determine that? One way is to ask yourself: &ldquo;Who am I writing for?&rdquo; these tests?». If the answer is &ldquo;I write them for myself to reduce costs for debugging&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the compiler to execute them,&rdquo; then it&rsquo;s quite possible that you are not writing the best tests. So, for whom Why write tests? For those who will try to understand your code.
Good tests serve as documentation for the code they are testing. They describe how the code works.

        When I encounter a system that has been in development or operation for a long time, the first sign of real trouble is always a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; log. You know what I&rsquo;m talking about: it&rsquo;s when clicking a link during normal web page usage results in a whole stream of messages being recorded in the system&rsquo;s single log. Too many log entries can be just as useless as having none at all.
If your systems are similar to mine, then when your work ends, the work of others begins. After the development is completed, the system will be long and successfully serve customers (if you&rsquo;re lucky). How will you learn about problems if the system is in operation, and what will you do about them?
