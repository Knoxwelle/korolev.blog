        Every software architect should know and understand that you can&rsquo;t get everything at once. In practice, it is impossible to design an architecture that has high performance, high availability, high security and high abstraction at the same time.There is one real story that software architects need to know, understand and tell their clients and colleagues.I mean the history of the Vaza.
In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. Wishing to put an end to this expensive war more quickly, the King of Sweden ordered the construction of a gallion called the Vase.It was an unusual ship.The requirements for it were not the same as for any other ship of the time.It was to be more than 60 metres long, carry 64 guns on two battery deck, and also carry 300 soldiers at a time for safe delivery to Poland by sea.

        We, technicians, choose to use certain technologies, methodologies and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the optimal solution, but only because in the depths of our heart we want to mention them in our summary. Such a choice very rarely leads to a positive result.
The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client.

        The fate of fate I started to go to interviews again, and I want to share some observations. On this, I just give advice to everyone in enterprise companies about how the recruitment process should be structured.
Advice to candidates In the last five years, I&rsquo;ve been through several hundred interviews on both sides. So, some life hacking:
You&rsquo;re going to have to go through the windshields. Those you&rsquo;re not going to go to. You pump the skill, or suddenly something interesting turns out to be, or it&rsquo;ll be the only place with the offer. You never know what&rsquo;s in a box of candy.
Get some sleep and let yourself rest on the day of wrath. The same live coding is quite a dumb thing; the solution may not come during the call but will appear immediately after.

        When faced with alternatives, people tend to believe that the most important thing is to make the right choice.In design (software products or anything else) this is not the case.The presence of an alternative is a sign that uncertainty in the design of the system needs to be analysed. Use uncertainty as a determining factor to identify places where you can postpone the transition to details or apply breakdown and abstraction to reduce the importance of design decisions.If you strictly “sew” in the system the first decision that came to your mind, it is likely to tie your hands in the future.As a result, random decisions will begin to play an important role, and the flexibility of the software product will decrease.
One of the simplest and most constructive definitions of architecture was given by Grady Booch: &ldquo;Any architecture is the result of design, but not every design is aimed at creating architecture.

        I&rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about Screening in enterprise companies, and how the recruitment process should be constructed.
Screening It all starts with it, and tech-screening becomes the norm. Recruiter directly on the first call asks cavernous questions and checks with sparkling. For example:
how to stop the container? unchanged data typesx in python? What&rsquo;s the PID of the Linux kernel? how do you decipher CAP and PACELC? &hellip; Some of them go even further and create an entire platform with small pieces of code that can be run. 20 questions in 20 minutes. &ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What does this code do?&rdquo; Well, he knows, I&rsquo;t just miss that code on a review, because it&rsquo;s wild.

        A good architect should set an example to others. He should be able to replace any member of his team and do anything from networking and configuring the assembly process to writing modular tests and performing performance tests. Without a good understanding of the entire range of technologies, an architect is little different from an ordinary project manager.Team members may have deeper knowledge in their narrow fields – this is perfectly normal – but they are unlikely to be able to trust their architect unless he is familiar with the technologies used.As has already been said, an architect is an interface between the technical team and the business, which means that he must understand all the technical aspects in order to play the role of the team representative before the business management, without constantly seeking help.

        &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be a requirement.As well as having a good response time.Or, say, &ldquo;expandable.&ldquo;The main reason is the lack of objective criteria for meeting such requirements.But users still need these features. The task of the architect is to ensure that the system has the necessary qualities, as well as to balance the inevitable contradictions that arise between them.Without objective criteria, the architect depends on the customer’s caprices (“No, I can’t accept the program – it doesn’t work fast enough”) and on the developers obsessed with obsessive ideas (“no, the program is not ready – it isn’t working fast enough”).
Usually we try to write down all such wishes, as well as any other requirements. But this entry very often looks like a set of foggy epithetics: “flexible”, “friendly to accompany” and so on.

        Too often, software architects live in ivory towers, leaving specifications to the developers and imposing technologies and directions on them. At the same time, this leads to strife, which is quickly followed by a “popular uprising.&quot; The result is a software product that has nothing to do with the original requirements. Every software architect must be able to explain to his colleagues the goals and objectives of the software project. The keys to effective communication are clarity and leadership.
Clearness characterizes the process of communication. No one in your group will read a 100-page document justifying your architectural decisions. The ability to express your thoughts clearly is vital to the success of any program or project. From the very beginning of work on the project, adhere to simple explanations and, in no case, start making long descriptions in Word.

        Customers and end-users often demand what they think is an effective solution to a problem. A classic example of this is given by Harry Hillaker, the leading designer of the F-16 Falcon. His group had set the goal of designing an aircraft developing M2–2.5 speeds, which was (and probably remains) a very non-trivial task, especially if the accompanying objective was to create a “cheap” light aircraft. Consider that the force required to overcome the air resistance increases by four times the speed of flight, and imagine how this circumstance affects the weight of the aircraft.
When the design team asked the Air Force customers why they needed the M2–2.5 speed, they replied, &ldquo;That the aircraft could get out of battle if necessary.&rdquo; When the real need became apparent, the designers were able to solve the main problem and present a workable solution: a mobile aircraft with high traction, providing good acceleration and maneuverability instead of high maximum speed.

        Proecting is a beautiful thing. A systematic, detailed presentation of the space of the problem and its solution reveals mistakes and reveals opportunities for improvement, sometimes in a very radical way.Specifications play an important role in this, as they define the pattern for building the system.It is very important to think about the entire architecture—both at the macro level, considering the interaction between the components, and at the micro level, penetrating the behavior of components themselves.
Unfortunately, architects are often fascinated by the design process, falling under the charm of architectural abstractions. However, the specifications themselves have no value. The ultimate objective of the software project is a really functioning system.The architect should always keep this goal in mind and remember that design is only a means, not the end result.
