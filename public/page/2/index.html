        The performance of an application is determined by its architecture. At first glance, it seems that this statement should be obvious, but real-world experience shows otherwise. For example, software architects often believe that application performance issues can be resolved simply by switching to software infrastructure from another vendor. The source of this belief may be the advertising hype surrounding testing results – for example, it is claimed that the leading company&rsquo;s product outperforms the nearest competitor by a certain percentage. However, if the leading product performs an operation in 3 milliseconds, while the competing product does it in 4 milliseconds, the claimed percentage (one millisecond) means very little against the backdrop of overall low performance rooted in architectural inefficiency.
Besides IT managers and performance testing teams, there are and other groups of people, such as the support service of the development company and authors of books on application performance management, which they recommend fine-tuning the application infrastructure: play with memory allocation operations, connection pool sizes, the sizes of thread pools and so on.

        You can ask 100 different people what any programmer should know and be able to do, and get 100 different answers. This can be both overwhelming and frightening. All advice is good, all principles are sound, all stories are convincing, but where to start? And, more importantly, once you start applying best practices, how do you maintain the right level and make them an integral part of your programming practice?
I think the answer lies in your mindset or simply in your approach. If you are indifferent to your fellow developers, testers, managers, sales and marketing staff, as well as end users, you will not feel the urge to, for example, conduct test-driven development or write clear comments in the code. I think there is a simple way to change your attitude and develop a desire to release products of the highest quality:

        You cover all the finished code or its fragments with automated tests. Congratulations! Do you write tests first and then code? Even better! Just because of this, you can be considered a programmer practicing advanced approaches in software development. But are your tests good? How can you determine that? One way is to ask yourself: &ldquo;Who am I writing for?&rdquo; these tests?». If the answer is &ldquo;I write them for myself to reduce costs for debugging&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the compiler to execute them,&rdquo; then it&rsquo;s quite possible that you are not writing the best tests. So, for whom Why write tests? For those who will try to understand your code.
Good tests serve as documentation for the code they are testing. They describe how the code works.

        It&rsquo;s getting close to evening. The team is diligently working on the new functionality planned for the current iteration; it seems even the air in the room is pulsing with the rhythm of work. However, John is a bit in a hurry: he has a date waiting for him. However, he manages to finish writing his part of the code, compiles it, registers it in the version control system – and hastily leaves. A few minutes later, the &ldquo;red light&rdquo; comes on: the application build is broken. John didn&rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he went with the &ldquo;hack and run&rdquo; principle, which caused the entire team&rsquo;s work to come to a halt.
The situation has changed – the work rhythm has been disrupted.

        Modern applications are extremely rarely created &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo; They are assembled from already existing building blocks – components, libraries, and frameworks, and there are several compelling reasons for this:
The volume, complexity, and sophistication of applications are increasing, while the time allocated for their creation is decreasing. It is more beneficial to spend the time and intellect of developers on business logic code rather than application infrastructure code. - Widely used components and frameworks have fewer chances of encountering errors compared to those developed independently. - High-quality tools are available for free on the Internet, which reduces development costs and simplifies the search for interested developers with the necessary experience. - The creation and maintenance of software require a significant amount of human labor, so it can be cheaper to buy ready-made products than to create them.

        You can prepare for a jump for a very long time, get used to the treadmill surface, take a run-up, but still never jump.
Design is a beautiful thing. A systematic, detailed representation of the problem space and its solution reveals errors and identifies opportunities for improvement, sometimes in quite radical ways. Specifications play an important role in this, as they define the template for building the system. It is very important to carefully consider the entire architecture—both at the macro level, examining the interaction between components, and at the micro level, delving into the behavior of the components themselves.
Unfortunately, architects often get carried away with the design process, falling under the charm of architectural abstractions. However, by themselves specifications have no value.

        When I encounter a system that has been in development or operation for a long time, the first sign of real trouble is always a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; log. You know what I&rsquo;m talking about: it&rsquo;s when clicking a link during normal web page usage results in a whole stream of messages being recorded in the system&rsquo;s single log. Too many log entries can be just as useless as having none at all.
If your systems are similar to mine, then when your work ends, the work of others begins. After the development is completed, the system will be long and successfully serve customers (if you&rsquo;re lucky). How will you learn about problems if the system is in operation, and what will you do about them?

        If you look at any activity, process, or discipline with sufficient long distance, everything seems simple. Managers who have no experience software development, believe that the work of a programmer is simple, and programmers who have no management experience feel the same way about the work of a manager.
Programming is a certain activity that some people spend some of their time on. And the most difficult part of the work—the thought process—is the least noticeable and the least appreciated by the uninitiated. For decades, attempts have been made to eliminate the need for skilled thinking personnel. One of the earliest and most memorable attempts was Grace Hopper&rsquo;s efforts to make programming languages less mysterious. Thanks to this, as some predicted, the need for narrowly specialized programmers may disappear.

        Attempts to prove the correctness of software manually lead to a formal proof that is longer than the code itself and contains errors more frequently than the code. It is preferable to use automated tools, but this is not always possible. Below, a middle ground is described: semi-formal proof of correctness.
The method is based on dividing the code under investigation into short fragments ranging from a single line, which may contain a function call, to blocks no longer than 10 lines, and discussing their correctness. The proof must be convincing enough for your colleague playing the role of the &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s advocate.&rdquo;
Fragments should be chosen in such a way that at the end point of the block, the program state (namely, the instruction address counter and the values of all &ldquo;live&rdquo; objects) satisfies a property that is simple to describe, and the functionality of this fragment (state transformation) can be easily described as a single independent task.

        Plato has one saying that, it seems to me, would be especially useful for all software developers to know and take to heart:
The beauty of style, harmony, elegance, and good rhythm are based on simplicity.
This single sentence embodies the values that we, as developers, should admire.
There are a number of things we aim to achieve in our code:
Readability - Ease of maintenance - Development speed - Elusive beauty Plato tells us that all these qualities are possible only thanks to simplicity.
What is beautiful code? This is probably a very subjective question. The perception of beauty is heavily dependent on personal experience, just as our perception of anything else is. Those who have studied art perceive beauty differently (at least approach it differently) than those with a technical education.
