      <description>Promising is a beautiful thing. Specifications are important in this sense because they set the foundation for building systems. Taking into account the behavior of individual components as well as the interconnections between them on a micro and macro scale is essential when analyzing the architecture as a whole.&#xA;Unfortunately, architects are often fascinated with design and gravitate toward architectural abstractions. However, the specs are meaningless on their own. The ultimate goal of the software project is to create a fully functional system. The architect should never lose sight of this goal or the fact that design is only a tool and not the finished product. The architect of the skyscraper would soon come to regret defying physics to achieve the elegant design of the edifice.</description>
