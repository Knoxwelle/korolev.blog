      <description>As technicians, we choose particular strategies, technologies, and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the greatest answer, but rather because we genuinely wish to incorporate them into our overview. Choosing such a course of action rarely pays off.&#xA;Your grateful clients who are lining up to recommend you to others will be the most effective career catalyst because of how well you have served them. The gracious customers will provide you with greater service than any recently developed paradigm or in-vogue item in the new language. Architects need to stay up to date on evolving concepts and technologies, but you should never try to take on additional work at the client&amp;rsquo;s expense. It is imperative for architects to always remember that their organization&amp;rsquo;s success is their responsibility.</description>
