      <description>Conducting code reviews is necessary. Why? It improves code quality and reduces the relative share of defects. But you may be misunderstanding why this happens.&#xA;Many programmers have an aversion to code reviews, which can be linked to their unfortunate personal experiences. I have encountered organizations where all code underwent formal review before it could enter the system for commercial use. Often, the review is conducted by an architect or lead developerâ€”a practice that can be called &amp;ldquo;the architect checks everything.&amp;rdquo; This is documented in the company&amp;rsquo;s software development process guide, and programmers are required to comply.&#xA;Perhaps, in some organizations, such a strict and formal process is indeed necessary, but they are in the minority. In most organizations, such an approach is counterproductive.</description>
