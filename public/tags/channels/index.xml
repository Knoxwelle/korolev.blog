      <description>Modern systems are distributed and loosely coupled.The construction of loosely connected systems creates quite a few troubles, so why do we go for it?Because we want our systems to be flexible and not fall apart at the slightest changes.This is a critical property in modern environments, where we control only a small part of our application, while everything else exists in the form of distributed services or packages that are managed by other departments or external vendors.&#xA;So, the desire to create a system that is flexible and capable of evolving over time is a good thing.But this also means that our system will gradually change.In other words, &amp;ldquo;today the system is no longer what it was yesterday.&amp;ldquo;Unfortunately, this noticeably complicates the documentation of the system.</description>
