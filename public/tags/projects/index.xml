      <description>Another salary calculation project is currently failing horribly somewhere; it&amp;rsquo;s probably not your fault.&#xA;Why did that happen? because Ruby was chosen by the developers instead of Smalltalk, Java, or Python? since you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you are aware, project failures are often attributed to technology.&#xA;Projects are typically started by people, and it is up to these people to determine whether the initiative succeeds or fails overall. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we should think about the ways we might help them succeed.&#xA;As a result, you think that one of the team members is performing poorly and preventing the project from moving forward.</description>

      <description>The scope of the project is defined by its boundaries.How much time, energy, and money are needed to put it into practice? What degree of quality and usefulness are necessary? To what extent is meeting the deadline for product delivery a challenge? What kind of danger exists? What are the boundaries? The project&amp;rsquo;s boundaries are established by the responses to these queries. Large-scale, intricate projects present a challenge that software architects relish. People are even tempted to inflate the project&amp;rsquo;s size in order to give the impression that it is more important due to the prospective rewards.However, because the chance of failure is increasing more quickly than anticipated, expanding borders is the enemy of success. An order of magnitude increase in project scale typically translates into an increased risk of failure.</description>
