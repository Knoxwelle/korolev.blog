      <description>The collection has long ceased to play the role of the &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; in the design of projects.Both architects (both at the application level and at the corporate level) should encourage the use of continuous integration methods and tools in each project.&#xA;The term continuous integration (CI, Continuous Integration) was first proposed by Martin Fowler as a design template. It means a set of methods and tools that ensure regular automatic assembly and testing of applications over short intervals of time (usually on an integration server specially designed to perform these operations).For any modern software project, the practice of continuous integration, combining modular testing methods and tools with automated assembly tools, becomes mandatory.&#xA;Continuous integration affects an integral element of the software development process – the point of converting the source code into a working application.</description>
