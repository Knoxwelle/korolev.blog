      <description>The collection no longer serves as the project&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; in terms of design. In every project, architects should promote the use of continuous integration techniques and technologies, both at the corporate and application levels.&#xA;Martin Fowler originally suggested the term continuous integration (CI) as a design template. It refers to a collection of techniques and equipment that guarantees consistent, automated application testing and assembly across brief intervals of time (sometimes on an integration server specifically created to carry out these tasks). Continuous integration, which combines automated assembly tools with modular testing techniques and tools, is now required for all modern software projects.&#xA;The project&amp;rsquo;s components are now assembled and put to the test. These days, continuous integration has taken the position of &amp;ldquo;early and frequent assembly.</description>
