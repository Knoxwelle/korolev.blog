      <description>A single data model, communication format, transport mechanism, and typically a single fundamental architectural element, policy, principle, etc., cannot adequately address every facet of a corporate organization. It appears that the system developers are perpetually surprised and saddened by this fact. It makes sense, though, that the organization—which is denoted here by the thick red line—must be too big and diverse to manage a single table, given that it is large enough to worry about the impact of multiple tables of accounts on the system over the course of the next ten years.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s also quite practical for us. Nonetheless, the contentious, complex, unofficial, and unsettling actual world of business is involved.Even worse, you have to deal with people&amp;rsquo;s perceptions of particular situations in specific regions of the world rather than the actual world.</description>
