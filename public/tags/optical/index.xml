      <description>For many of us, an architect&amp;rsquo;s career began with some sort of purely technical position, where success was largely determined by the ability to communicate with computers.But as an architect, we have to communicate mainly with other people. Whether you are discussing the advantages of a template with developers or explaining to management the pros and cons of buying intermediate software, your communication skills are the key to success.&#xA;Objectively measure the degree of influence of the architect on the project is quite difficult, but one thing is quite clear: if the developers constantly ignore the instructions of the Architect, and the management does not attach importance to his recommendations, the &amp;ldquo;correctness&amp;rdquo; of the actions of architect will not affect the development of his career.</description>
