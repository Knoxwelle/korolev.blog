      <description>When it comes to developing a software architecture, we first imagine the classic technical operations: system breakdown into modules, defining interfaces, allocating responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance.In addition, the architect must take into account a number of other aspects, including safety, ease of use, easy maintenance, output management, choice of deployment settings, etc.However, all of these technical and procedural aspects must be relevant to the needs of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account in the analysis of requirements is a great way to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are complete.&#xA;All parties involved in the project have interests affecting both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole. It is the analysis of these interests that forms the resulting set of priorities for the architect.</description>

      <description>One data model, one message format, one transport mechanism (and generally exactly one basic architectural component, policy, principle, etc.) cannot serve all aspects of a business organization equally well.It seems that this fact is an endless source of surprise and sadness for the developers of the systems.At the same time, it is quite natural: since the organization (the word “organization” is highlighted here with the fat red line) is large enough to worry about how several different tables of accounts will affect the system in the next decade, it must be too large and heterogeneous to be able to handle a single table.&#xA;In the technical field, uniformity can be enforced.And it&amp;rsquo;s very convenient for us.However, in the field of business, a controversial, multifaceted, informal, troubling real world comes into play.</description>
