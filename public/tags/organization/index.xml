      <description>When designing a software architecture, the conventional technical procedures that spring to mind are disassembling the system into its constituent pieces, specifying interfaces, allocating responsibilities, employing templates, and optimizing performance. A wide range of other variables, including output management, deployment settings, convenience of use, safety, and maintenance, must also be taken into account by the architect.Meanwhile, every one of these technical and procedural specifics must be relevant to the requirements of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account during the requirements analysis process is one of the greatest ways to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are thorough.&#xA;Every project participant has interests that affect both the company&amp;rsquo;s software development process and the firm as a whole. Taking these interests into account leads to the architect&amp;rsquo;s final list of priorities.</description>

      <description>Every aspect of a business organization is too complex for a single data model, communication format, transport mechanism, and usually a single core architectural element, policy, principle, etc. to handle well. It seems that this truth always surprises and depresses the system developers. But given that the company is large enough to be concerned about the effects of numerous tables of accounts on the system over the next ten years, it makes sense that it must be too huge and diverse to manage a single table. The organization is represented by the thick red line in this example.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s also quite useful to us. Still, it involves the tense, intricate, informal, and disconcerting real world of business. Even worse, instead of dealing with real reality, you have to deal with people&amp;rsquo;s views of specific situations in specific parts of the world.</description>
