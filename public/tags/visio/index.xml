      <description>All too frequently, software architects reside in ivory towers, dictating technologies and instructions to developers while leaving them with little to no guidance. Simultaneously, this causes conflict, which is soon followed by a &amp;ldquo;popular uprising.&amp;rdquo; The end product is a piece of software that bears no relation to the original specifications. It is imperative for any software architect to be able to articulate to his peers the aims and purposes of the software project. Effective communication relies on leadership and clarity.&#xA;A communication procedure that is clear and concise. A one hundred-page document explaining your architectural choices will not be read by anyone in your group. Effective communication of ideas is essential for any program or effort to succeed. When starting work on the project, stick to brief explanations and don&amp;rsquo;t start writing lengthy word descriptions.</description>
