      <description>Customers and end users often insist on what they see to be a practical resolution to a problem. Harry Hillaker, a leading F-16 Falcon designer, offers a perfect example of this. The goal set for his team was to build an aircraft capable of traveling at M2-2.5 speeds. This was (and presumably still is) a very challenging project, particularly if the secondary objective was to construct a light aircraft that was &amp;ldquo;cheap.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The design team was informed by Air Force clients that the M2â€“2.5 speed was critical for the aircraft to be able to escape combat if needed. When the true necessity was realized, the designers addressed the main problem and offered a workable solution. Rather than having a fast peak speed, this was in the form of a movable aircraft with good traction that provided good acceleration and maneuverability.</description>
