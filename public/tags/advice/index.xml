      <description>I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.&#xA;Examining Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:&#xA;-How is it possible to halt the container? The original data types in Python? What is the PID of the Linux kernel? How are PACELC and CAP understood?&#xA;-&amp;hellip; Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; Or even &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it in a review.</description>

      <description>Less is more. It&amp;rsquo;s a clichéd short maxim, but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s really true.&#xA;Over the past few weeks, among the improvements I made to our code was the removal of some of its fragments.&#xA;We were developing the project following the principles of extreme programming, including YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It). But human nature is imperfect, and in some places we made mistakes.&#xA;I noticed that our product took an unjustifiably long time to perform certain tasks—simple tasks that should have been completed almost instantly. This was all because we overcomplicated their implementation—with all sorts of trinkets and bows that were actually unnecessary but seemed useful at some point.&#xA;So, I simplified the code, improved the product&amp;rsquo;s performance, and reduced the overall code entropy, all thanks to removing unnecessary functions from the project code.</description>
