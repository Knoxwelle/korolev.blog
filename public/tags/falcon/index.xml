      <description>Clients and end users frequently insist on what they perceive to be a workable solution to an issue. Leading F-16 Falcon designer Harry Hillaker provides a prime illustration of this. His team&amp;rsquo;s mission was to construct an airplane that could reach M2-2.5 speeds. This was (and probably still is) a tremendously difficult undertaking, especially if the secondary goal was to build a light aircraft that was &amp;ldquo;cheap.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Air Force clients told the design team that they required the M2â€“2.5 speed so that the aircraft could escape combat if necessary. The primary issue was resolved, and a feasible solution was presented by the designers when the true necessity became evident. This was in the form of a mobile aircraft with strong traction that offered good acceleration and maneuverability rather than a high top speed.</description>
