      <description>It makes it possible to withstand isolated hardware failures, but it also makes it more likely that the system will malfunction at least once at any given time.&#xA;Additionally susceptible is the software code. We use monitoring tools to record application problems; but, as these tools rely on software code, they are likewise susceptible to malfunction.&#xA;Because humans make mistakes, we attempt to automate our workflows, diagnoses, and actions.Automation lowers the probability of errors resulting from rule violations but raises the probability of errors originating from rule noncompliance.A human being can react to a wider variety of situations than any automated technology.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re including monitoring methods in automation tools because of this. Fresh flaws in new software. Hardware, software, and lengthy communication links make up networks.</description>
