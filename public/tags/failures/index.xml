      <description>Equipment is vulnerable to damage, so we&amp;rsquo;re introducing excess in our systems.It allows you to survive individual hardware failures, but increases the likelihood that at any time at least one malfunction will be present in the system.&#xA;The software code is also vulnerable. Our applications are based on software code, which means they are vulnerable too.We implement monitoring tools that report application failures, but these tools are also based on software code, which means that they are vulnerable to failure themselves.&#xA;So people make mistakes, so we try to automate our actions, diagnostics and workflows.Automation reduces the likelihood of errors caused by breaches of rules, but increases the likeliness of mistakes resulting from lack of rules.No automated system is capable of responding to such a range of situations as a human being.</description>
