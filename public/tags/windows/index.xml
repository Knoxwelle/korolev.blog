      <description>Somewhere right now, a different wage calculation project is failing miserably&amp;hellip; and most likely not by yourself.&#xA;What caused that to occur? because the developers opted for Ruby over Smalltalk or Java or Python? since you choose to utilize Postgres over Oracle? or because you preferred the Windows platform even if you should have chosen Linux? As you are aware, technology is frequently held responsible for project failures.&#xA;People normally establish projects, and it is up to these individuals to decide whether the project as a whole succeeds or fails. And once that is the case, we ought to consider our options for assisting them in being successful.&#xA;Per, you believe that there is a team member that is underperforming and impeding the project&amp;rsquo;s progress.</description>
