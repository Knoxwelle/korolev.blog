      <description>Why do we create temporary solutions?&#xA;Usually, the culprit is an urgent task. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s an internal task for developersâ€”to create a missing tool for the development chain. Other times, the task is external, user-oriented, such as a workaround to compensate for missing functionality.&#xA;In most systems and teams, you can find a module that somehow stands out in the system. It is considered a draft version, and it will need to be redone later because it does not meet the standards and rules that the rest of the code lives by. You will definitely have to hear developers&amp;rsquo; complaints about this. The reasons for the appearance of such code can vary, but the main reason for the emergence of intermediate solutions is their usefulness.</description>
