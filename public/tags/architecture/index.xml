      <description>I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.&#xA;Examining Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:&#xA;-How is it possible to halt the container? The original data types in Python? What is the PID of the Linux kernel? How are PACELC and CAP understood?&#xA;-&amp;hellip; Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; Or even &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it in a review.</description>

      <description>An architecture cannot accomplish high security, high availability, high abstraction, and high performance all at once. All that software architects need to do is know, understand, and relate one real narrative to their peers and clients. I am speaking of Vaza&amp;rsquo;s history.&#xA;In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. An attempt was made to bring this expensive war to an early end by the Swedish King by ordering the construction of a gallion known as the vase. The ship was not like the others. It was unlike any other ship of the time in its features. It had to be longer than sixty meters in order to safely convey 300 men at a time to Poland while also carrying 64 weapons on two battery decks.</description>
