      <description>You can prepare for a jump for a very long time, get used to the treadmill surface, take a run-up, but still never jump.&#xA;Design is a beautiful thing. A systematic, detailed representation of the problem space and its solution reveals errors and identifies opportunities for improvement, sometimes in quite radical ways. Specifications play an important role in this, as they define the template for building the system. It is very important to carefully consider the entire architectureâ€”both at the macro level, examining the interaction between components, and at the micro level, delving into the behavior of the components themselves.&#xA;Unfortunately, architects often get carried away with the design process, falling under the charm of architectural abstractions. However, by themselves specifications have no value.</description>
