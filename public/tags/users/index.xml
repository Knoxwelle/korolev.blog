      <description>When it comes to civil rights, identity theft, or malware, the ethical nature of software is made clear. But in calves, it also appears in less unusual situations.The lives of thousands, if not millions, of people are impacted by successful initiatives. They may have both beneficial and detrimental effects.&#xA;Whenever I decide how software should behave, I really decide what its users may and cannot do. Furthermore, the verdict is far harsher than the legislation because there is no appeal court where the selection of required fields or the rigid order of transactions may be disputed.&#xA;The scale effect provides another perspective on this issue. Do you recall articles about the newest viruses on the Internet or popular films? You have to have fulfilled the approximations of the number of working hours lost nationwide as a result of them.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; cannot be a requirement. Not only does it have a quick reaction time, but it&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;ldquo;expandable.&amp;rdquo; The main reason is that there are no unbiased guidelines for carrying out these responsibilities.Nevertheless, users need these functionalities. The architect&amp;rsquo;s duties include making sure the system possesses the necessary characteristics and resolving the inevitable conflicts that arise between them. In the absence of objective benchmarks, the architect is forced to rely on the developer&amp;rsquo;s obsession with inane concepts (“No, the program is not ready; it isn&amp;rsquo;t working fast enough”) and his or her own whims (“No, I can&amp;rsquo;t accept the program; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work fast enough”).&#xA;Generally, we try to document all of these requests along with any other information. All too often, though, this section seems to be a list of vague words like &amp;ldquo;friendly to accompany,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;flexible,&amp;rdquo; and so on.</description>
