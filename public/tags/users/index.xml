      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t make &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; a prerequisite. In addition to having a fast reaction time.alternatively, &amp;ldquo;expandable.&amp;rdquo; The primary cause is the absence of impartial standards for fulfilling these obligations.Users nevertheless require these features. Ensuring that the system has the required attributes and balancing the inevitable contradictions that occur between them are the tasks of the architect. Without objective standards, the developer&amp;rsquo;s fixation with obsessive concepts (“No, the program is not ready; it isn&amp;rsquo;t working fast enough”) and the architect&amp;rsquo;s whims (“No, I can&amp;rsquo;t accept the program; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work fast enough”) are what the architect counts on.&#xA;Usually, we make an effort to record all such requests along with any additional specifications. However, this entry frequently appears to be a collection of hazy adjectives, such as &amp;ldquo;flexible,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;friendly to accompany,&amp;rdquo; and so forth.</description>
