      <description>In Neal Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s novel &amp;ldquo;Cryptonomicon,&amp;rdquo; Randy Waterhouse presents his classification of the races he has encountered.Gnomes are hard workers, toiling over works of art in the darkness of their caves.They command immense forces capable of moving mountains and transforming landscapes, and they are renowned for their skill. Elves are distinguished by their sophistication and high culture; they spend their days creating new beautiful magical objects.They are so talented that they don&amp;rsquo;t even realize how supernatural these objects appear to other races. Wizards are endowed with immense power, but unlike elves, they know a great deal about magic, understand its nature and possibilities, and apply it in the most effective and impressive ways. However, there is also a fourth type that Waterhouse mentions briefly, without pausing for a detailed description.</description>
