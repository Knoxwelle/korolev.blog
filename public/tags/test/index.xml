      <description>The needs of business application users are mostly stated in functional requirements. The non-functional components of the system, such as performance, flexibility, downtime, support needs, etc., are under the architect&amp;rsquo;s control. Concurrently, the system maintenance team may be given full responsibility for the initial testing of non-functional requirements, or the testing may be postponed until a very late stage of the development process.&#xA;This is a mistake that happens far more often than it should. It could have several foundations. Worrying about the program&amp;rsquo;s speed and flexibility while it isn&amp;rsquo;t yet perfectly performing the required role may seem pointless. The tests themselves are rather complex, as are the test settings. Early working versions of the system may not have been subjected to a realistic load because of their low use intensity.</description>
