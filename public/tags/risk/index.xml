      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few different programming projects. All of them encountered problems that turned out to be more difficult than the development team had predicted. This typically manifested itself in the following ways: although a minority of team members saw these problems at an early stage, most workers rejected or ignored any warning signs since they were too late to realize how serious they were.&#xA;This happens for a number of reasons:&#xA;-Project-related issues that don&amp;rsquo;t seem vital at first become crucial when it&amp;rsquo;s too late to fix them.
