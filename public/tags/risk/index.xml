      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a bunch of programming projects.Each of them encountered problems that caused more trouble than the developer team expected.This often occurred as follows: some team members noticed such problems early, but most staff rejected or ignored all symptoms because they did not realize their importance until it was too late.&#xA;This happens for a variety of reasons:&#xA;Problems that seem trivial at an early stage of the project become critical when ix is too late to fix.The story of a welded frog is probably an exaggeration, but it perfectly illustrates what is happening in many projects.&#xA;Some employees often encounter resistance when other team members do not have similar experience or knowledge.Overcoming this resistance requires exceptional courage, confidence and persistence, and these qualities are rarely possessed even by highly paid experienced consultants hired specifically to prevent such problems.</description>
