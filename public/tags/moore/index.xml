Yes, the fact that it can only go a maximum of 10 km/h is the only issue. Did you not make up your mind?

Furthermore, Moore&amp;rsquo;s law will ensure everything is taken care of if current systems are not quick enough.But the equipment&amp;rsquo;s speed is simply one component of the system.&#xA;Some people define performance as only how long it takes a system to react to input from them.</description>
