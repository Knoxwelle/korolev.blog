      <description>The Law of Unintended Consequences states: &amp;ldquo;Assumptions are the root of all failures.&amp;ldquo;Of course, the wording isn&amp;rsquo;t very serious, but when assumptions cost you several thousand (or even millions) of dollars, it’s no laughing matter.&#xA;The experience of software architects indicates that the rationale for each decision made should be documented, especially if the decision involves a compromise (between performance and maintainability, between cost and time to market, etc.).In a more formal approach, the context in which each decision is made is recorded, including the factors that influenced the final choice. Such factors can include not only functional or non-functional requirements but also facts (or &amp;ldquo;factoids&amp;rdquo;) that seem important to the decision-maker (such as technology constraints, employee qualifications, the political environment, etc.).&#xA;The practice of documenting decisions is useful because listing these factors helps to highlight the implicit assumptions that influence important decisions regarding the designed product.</description>
