      <description>Psychology of Programming: It has long been known that a programmer&amp;rsquo;s professionalism directly depends on the number of different programming paradigms they masterâ€”not just having heard of them and knowing about them, but being able to actually use them in their work.&#xA;Every programmer starts with some one language. This language has an the predominant influence on how a programmer sees software. But no matter how long a programmer has worked with this language, if they only work with it, they will only know this language. The thinking of a programmer who knows only one language is limited to the capabilities of that language.&#xA;A programmer learning a second language will encounter difficulties, especially if the computational model of the second language differs from the first.</description>
