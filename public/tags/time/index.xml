      <description>I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.&#xA;Examining Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:&#xA;-How is it possible to halt the container? The original data types in Python? What is the PID of the Linux kernel? How are PACELC and CAP understood?&#xA;-&amp;hellip; Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; Or even &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it in a review.</description>

      <description>Seeing what has survived and what hasn&amp;rsquo;t has long been one of my favorite vivid forms of amusement. There were a plethora of patterns, infrastructures, paradigm shifts, and algorithms. Wise people debated them fervently, considered long-term views, and attempted to strike a balance between all the known components, but in the end, they came to naught. Why? What is the past attempting to teach us?&#xA;Pick a noble assignment For a software architect, this is highly challenging. We receive assignments and issues from the client, so we really don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice, do we? It&amp;rsquo;s not really that easy. First of all, we frequently make the error of thinking that we have little power over what the customer desires. But it&amp;rsquo;s typically possible to just step outside of your comfort zone when it comes to technology.</description>

      <title>Architectural compromises</title>

      <description>An architecture cannot accomplish high security, high availability, high abstraction, and high performance all at once. All that software architects need to do is know, understand, and relate one real narrative to their peers and clients. I am speaking of Vaza&amp;rsquo;s history.&#xA;In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. An attempt was made to bring this expensive war to an early end by the Swedish King by ordering the construction of a gallion known as the vase. The ship was not like the others. It was unlike any other ship of the time in its features. It had to be longer than sixty meters in order to safely convey 300 men at a time to Poland while also carrying 64 weapons on two battery decks.</description>

      <description>There are several reasons why a software project might not succeed. One of the most common reasons projects fail is modifying the work schedule in the middle of the project without adequate planning. These kinds of failures can be avoided, but it will require a large team effort to do so. Changes to a project&amp;rsquo;s schedule or resource allocation usually don&amp;rsquo;t result in any problems. Problems occur when you have to work longer hours in the same amount of time or shorten the schedule without reducing the task.&#xA;The myth that you may shorten the schedule to save costs or speed product delivery is one that is widely held. More hours are typically put in, or &amp;ldquo;less important tasks&amp;rdquo; (such as modular testing) are abandoned in order to produce a product faster or with better functionality that doesn&amp;rsquo;t delay delivery.</description>
