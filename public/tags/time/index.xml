      <title>To do something hastily and run away is a crime</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s getting close to evening. The team is diligently working on the new functionality planned for the current iteration; it seems even the air in the room is pulsing with the rhythm of work. However, John is a bit in a hurry: he has a date waiting for him. However, he manages to finish writing his part of the code, compiles it, registers it in the version control system – and hastily leaves. A few minutes later, the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; comes on: the application build is broken. John didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he went with the &amp;ldquo;hack and run&amp;rdquo; principle, which caused the entire team&amp;rsquo;s work to come to a halt.&#xA;The situation has changed – the work rhythm has been disrupted.</description>

      <title>Architectural compromises</title>

      <description>An architecture cannot accomplish high security, high availability, high abstraction, and high performance all at once. All that software architects need to do is know, understand, and relate one real narrative to their peers and clients. I am speaking of Vaza&amp;rsquo;s history.&#xA;In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. An attempt was made to bring this expensive war to an early end by the Swedish King by ordering the construction of a galleon known as the vase. The ship was not like the others. It was unlike any other ship of the time in its features. It had to be longer than sixty meters in order to safely convey 300 men at a time to Poland while also carrying 64 weapons on two battery decks.</description>

      <title>Know your IDE</title>

      <description>In the 1980s, the programming environment, as a rule, did not differ much from an advanced text editor – at best. Today, we take syntax highlighting for granted, but back then it was a luxury not available to everyone. Code formatting tools existed as external tools, the use of which corrected spacing. Debuggers also &amp;ldquo;lived&amp;rdquo; separately as programs for step-by-step code execution, and working with them required knowing a multitude of mysterious key combinations.&#xA;In the 1990s, companies began to realize the profit potential of more convenient and useful development tools. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) combined previously offered editing features with a compiler, debugger, formatting tools, and other instruments. At that time, menus and mice became popular, which meant that developers no longer needed to memorize complex key combinations to work with their editor.</description>

      <description>I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.&#xA;Examining Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:&#xA;-How is it possible to halt the container? The original data types in Python? What is the PID of the Linux kernel? How are PACELC and CAP understood?&#xA;-&amp;hellip; Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; Or even &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it in a review.</description>

      <description>There are several reasons why a software project might not succeed. One of the most common reasons projects fail is modifying the work schedule in the middle of the project without adequate planning. These kinds of failures can be avoided, but it will require a large team effort to do so. Changes to a project&amp;rsquo;s schedule or resource allocation usually don&amp;rsquo;t result in any problems. Problems occur when you have to work longer hours in the same amount of time or shorten the schedule without reducing the task.&#xA;The myth that you may shorten the schedule to save costs or speed product delivery is one that is widely held. More hours are typically put in, or &amp;ldquo;less important tasks&amp;rdquo; (such as modular testing) are abandoned in order to produce a product faster or with better functionality that doesn&amp;rsquo;t delay delivery.</description>

      <title>When programmers and testers collaborate</title>

      <description>When testers and programmers start collaborating, miracles happen. Less time is spent playing ping-pong with defects in the defect tracking system. Less time is spent discussing whether the behavior is a bug or a new feature, and more time is spent on developing quality. software that meets customer expectations. There is many opportunities to establish collaboration even before the coding begins.&#xA;Testers can help clients write acceptance tests in the language their subject area using tools such as Fit (Framework for Integration test). If these tests are given to the programmers before they start writing code, they will be able to apply the practice of acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Programmers write frameworks to run the tests, and then code to ensure they pass. these tests.</description>

      <description>You can prepare for a jump for a very long time, get used to the treadmill surface, take a run-up, but still never jump.&#xA;Design is a beautiful thing. A systematic, detailed representation of the problem space and its solution reveals errors and identifies opportunities for improvement, sometimes in quite radical ways. Specifications play an important role in this, as they define the template for building the system. It is very important to carefully consider the entire architecture—both at the macro level, examining the interaction between components, and at the micro level, delving into the behavior of the components themselves.&#xA;Unfortunately, architects often get carried away with the design process, falling under the charm of architectural abstractions. However, by themselves specifications have no value.</description>

      <title>Before blaming others, check your own code</title>

      <description>A developer – any of us! – often finds it difficult to admit that their code doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. It seems so implausible that we are more likely to assume there is a bug in the compiler.&#xA;In reality, it is very, very rare for code to be non-functional due to a bug in the compiler, interpreter, operating system, application server, database, memory manager, or any other element of system software. Yes, there are bugs, but they are much less frequent than we would like to think.&#xA;Once, I actually encountered a bug in the compiler (removing the loop variable during optimization), but in all other cases, my complaints about the compiler or operating system turned out to be unfounded. I wasted a lot of my time, support staff time, and management time, only to end up in an awkward position when it turned out that the mistake was my own.</description>

      <description>Seeing what has survived and what hasn&amp;rsquo;t has long been one of my favorite vivid forms of amusement. There were a plethora of patterns, infrastructures, paradigm shifts, and algorithms. Wise people debated them fervently, considered long-term views, and attempted to strike a balance between all the known components, but in the end, they came to naught. Why? What is the past attempting to teach us?&#xA;Pick a noble assignment For a software architect, this is highly challenging. We receive assignments and issues from the client, so we really don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice, do we? It&amp;rsquo;s not really that easy. First of all, we frequently make the error of thinking that we have little power over what the customer desires. But it&amp;rsquo;s typically possible to just step outside of your comfort zone when it comes to technology.</description>

      <title>Use quantitative criteria</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; cannot be a requirement. Nor can &amp;ldquo;having a good response time.&amp;rdquo; Or, let&amp;rsquo;s say, &amp;ldquo;scalable.&amp;rdquo; The main reason is the lack of objective criteria for meeting such requirements. But users still need these characteristics. The architect&amp;rsquo;s task is to ensure that the system possesses the necessary qualities and to balance the inevitable contradictions that arise. between them. Without objective criteria, the architect depends on whims the client (&amp;ldquo;No, I can&amp;rsquo;t accept the program – it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work fast enough&amp;rdquo;) and the developers, obsessed with their compulsions (&amp;ldquo;No, the program isn&amp;rsquo;t ready yet – it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work fast enough&amp;rdquo;).&#xA;Usually, we try to record all such requests, just like any other requirements. But this record often looks like a set of vague epithets: &amp;ldquo;flexible,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;easy to accompany,&amp;rdquo; and so on.</description>
