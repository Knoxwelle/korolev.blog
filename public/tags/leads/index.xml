      <description>A typical problem with them is that a lot of frameworks, class libraries, fundamental services, and other infrastructure code are designed to be utilized anywhere and aren&amp;rsquo;t specific to any one application. Since most developers are experts in specific systems, it rarely helps them to try to be as adaptable as possible. The best way to achieve universality isn&amp;rsquo;t through universality based on conjecture, but rather through a careful understanding of well-known concrete examples and an analysis of their essence to find a fundamentally shared solution. Experience in the real world leads to simplicity.&#xA;Making an architectural design simpler rather than more feature-rich makes it simpler to decide between two solutions that are identical to each other. When there are two possibilities, go with the simpler, needs-based solution rather than the more flexible, complex one.</description>
