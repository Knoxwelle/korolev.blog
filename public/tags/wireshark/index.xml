      <description>A competent architect ought to lead by example. He should be able to take the position of any team member and handle any task, including creating modular tests, conducting performance tests, and setting up networking and the assembly process. In the absence of a thorough comprehension of all available technologies, an architect is really no different from a regular project manager.Although it is rather typical for team members to be more knowledgeable in their specialized professions, they are unlikely to be able to trust their architect unless he is conversant with the technology being employed.Since an architect serves as a liaison between the technical team and the company, as has already been mentioned, he must be well-versed in all technical facets in order to represent the team to the business management without continuously seeking assistance.</description>
