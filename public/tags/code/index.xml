      <title>Сделать наспех и сбежать это преступление</title>

      <description>Time is approaching evening.The command is friendly about the new functionality scheduled for the current iteration; it seems that even the air in the room is pulsing at a working pace.However, John is a little in a hurry: he is waiting for a date.However, he has time to rewrite his part of the code, compiles it, registers in the source code management system – and rushes away.A few minutes later, the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; is lit: the assembly of the app is disrupted.John didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he acted on the rush and run principle, causing the entire team to stall.&#xA;The situation has changed – the working rhythm has failed. Now everyone knows that when you update the code from the version control system, the code will not work on their local computers, and because the team will have to integrate a lot of code to prepare for the upcoming demonstration, this becomes a serious obstacle.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about Screening in enterprise companies, and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Screening It all starts with it, and tech-screening becomes the norm. Recruiter directly on the first call asks cavernous questions and checks with sparkling. For example:&#xA;how to stop the container? unchanged data typesx in python? What&amp;rsquo;s the PID of the Linux kernel? how do you decipher CAP and PACELC? &amp;hellip; Some of them go even further and create an entire platform with small pieces of code that can be run. 20 questions in 20 minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; Well, he knows, I&amp;rsquo;t just miss that code on a review, because it&amp;rsquo;s wild.</description>

      <description>Proecting is a beautiful thing. A systematic, detailed presentation of the space of the problem and its solution reveals mistakes and reveals opportunities for improvement, sometimes in a very radical way.Specifications play an important role in this, as they define the pattern for building the system.It is very important to think about the entire architecture—both at the macro level, considering the interaction between the components, and at the micro level, penetrating the behavior of components themselves.&#xA;Unfortunately, architects are often fascinated by the design process, falling under the charm of architectural abstractions. However, the specifications themselves have no value. The ultimate objective of the software project is a really functioning system.The architect should always keep this goal in mind and remember that design is only a means, not the end result.</description>

      <title>Live Coding</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about live coding in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Live Coding There&amp;rsquo;s always a lot of noise around him. Some people like it (interviews), some people don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all (candidates), and someone goes to a psychologist after him for six months. This is not really to understand that the candidate is able to code; there are not enough extensive projects on Github, profile articles with code, reports after all. As I was told, this is done to ensure that everyone is treated equally in recruitment. Well, good luck hiring a leader or a gentleman in five rounds. At the second, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask himself, &amp;ldquo;Do I really need this?</description>
