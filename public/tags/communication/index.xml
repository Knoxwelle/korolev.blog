      <description>For many of us, an architect&amp;rsquo;s career began with some sort of purely technical position, where success was largely determined by the ability to communicate with computers.But as an architect, we have to communicate mainly with other people. Whether you are discussing the advantages of a template with developers or explaining to management the pros and cons of buying intermediate software, your communication skills are the key to success.&#xA;Objectively measure the degree of influence of the architect on the project is quite difficult, but one thing is quite clear: if the developers constantly ignore the instructions of the Architect, and the management does not attach importance to his recommendations, the &amp;ldquo;correctness&amp;rdquo; of the actions of architect will not affect the development of his career.</description>

      <description>Too often, software architects live in ivory towers, leaving specifications to the developers and imposing technologies and directions on them. At the same time, this leads to strife, which is quickly followed by a “popular uprising.&amp;quot; The result is a software product that has nothing to do with the original requirements. Every software architect must be able to explain to his colleagues the goals and objectives of the software project. The keys to effective communication are clarity and leadership.&#xA;Clearness characterizes the process of communication. No one in your group will read a 100-page document justifying your architectural decisions. The ability to express your thoughts clearly is vital to the success of any program or project. From the very beginning of work on the project, adhere to simple explanations and, in no case, start making long descriptions in Word.</description>

      <title>Perhaps your main problem is not technology</title>

      <description>Right now, somewhere is suffering the disaster of another project of a wage calculation system&amp;hellip; And probably not alone.&#xA;Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you know, all project failures are usually blamed on technology. But was your task really so complex that the Java capabilities were not enough for it?&#xA;Projects are usually created by people, and it is these people that determine the success or failure of the whole project. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we need to think a little bit about how to help them succeed.</description>
