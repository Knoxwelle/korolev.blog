      <description>Right now somewhere is suffering the disaster of another project of wage calculation system&amp;hellip; And probably not alone.&#xA;Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? Or because you preferred the Windows platform, even though you should have chosen Linux? As you know, all failures of projects are usually blamed on technology. But was your task really so complex that the Java capabilities were not enough for it?&#xA;Projects are usually created by people, and it is these people that determine the success or failure of the whole project.And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we need to think a little bit about how to help them succeed.</description>
