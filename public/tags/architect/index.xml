      <description>For many of us, an architect&amp;rsquo;s career began with some sort of purely technical position, where success was largely determined by the ability to communicate with computers.But as an architect, we have to communicate mainly with other people. Whether you are discussing the advantages of a template with developers or explaining to management the pros and cons of buying intermediate software, your communication skills are the key to success.&#xA;Objectively measure the degree of influence of the architect on the project is quite difficult, but one thing is quite clear: if the developers constantly ignore the instructions of the Architect, and the management does not attach importance to his recommendations, the &amp;ldquo;correctness&amp;rdquo; of the actions of architect will not affect the development of his career.</description>

      <description>A good architect should set an example to others. He should be able to replace any member of his team and do anything from networking and configuring the assembly process to writing modular tests and performing performance tests. Without a good understanding of the entire range of technologies, an architect is little different from an ordinary project manager.Team members may have deeper knowledge in their narrow fields – this is perfectly normal – but they are unlikely to be able to trust their architect unless he is familiar with the technologies used.As has already been said, an architect is an interface between the technical team and the business, which means that he must understand all the technical aspects in order to play the role of the team representative before the business management, without constantly seeking help.</description>

      <description>The architect must continuously refine and improve his &amp;ldquo;context noe poche&amp;rdquo;, since there is no single universal solution for a wide range of diverse problems.Eberhardt Rechtin, in his book &amp;ldquo;Systems Architecting: Creating &amp;amp; Building Complex Systems&amp;rdquo; (Prentice Hall, 1991):&#xA;“To learn the basic principles of the “eristic approach” to the design of complex systems, ask an experienced architect what he does when faced with a difficult task.His answer would most likely be, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just using common sense.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;&amp;hellip;&amp;gt;Instead of the term “sensual” it would be better to use the expression “context sensation”1 – knowledge of what is ra zoom in a given context.Education, experience and study of examples allow the architect-practitioner to acquire a considerable power of contextual sense by the moment when it is entrusted to solve a system-level problem – usually it takes decades.</description>

      <description>In the context of the development of corporate software applications, the architect should become a kind of bridge in the company between the business and technical communities, representing and defending the interests of both sides and often acting as a mediator between them, but at the same time allowing the business to control the affairs.When making technological decisions, the architect must be guided by the business objectives of the company and its surrounding realities.&#xA;Before undertaking a software development project, a commercial company usually plans and announces the desired return on investment (ROI).The architect must accept this indicator and the resulting limitations of the value of the product created for the company.This will help to avoid technical solutions that could lead to excessive expenditure.</description>
