      <description>There has been a depressing tendency in the field of software development lately: the aim to elevate software design to a professional standing comparable to that of the traditional school of architecture. Architects seem to want to validate their accomplishments in the eyes of the general public instead of their immediate employers and network of peers. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the end of the 19th century—a millennium after its inception—that architecture achieved professional stature. Some software architects rush their attempts to gain attention.&#xA;However, software development is still in its infancy. This industry still lacks enough knowledge for us to credibly classify it as professional. The software development sector is relatively new, but despite this, its products are highly appreciated, and qualified experts in the field—as well as those who aspire to appear—are compensated at a level commensurate with top professional disciplines like law, accounting, and medicine.</description>

      <description>For a wide range of different problems, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single, comprehensive solution, so the architect must continuously refine and improve his &amp;ldquo;context noe poche.&amp;rdquo; Eberhardt Rechtin writes in &amp;ldquo;Systems Architecting: Creating and Building Complex Systems&amp;rdquo; (Prentice Hall, 1991):&#xA;&amp;lt;&amp;hellip;&amp;gt; Rather than using the word &amp;ldquo;sensual,&amp;rdquo; it might be better to speak to it as &amp;ldquo;context sensation&amp;rdquo;—knowledge of what is pertinent in a certain context. By the time an architect-practitioner is called to address a system-level issue, which usually takes decades, they can have a strong contextual awareness thanks to education, experience, and case studies.&#xA;One of the biggest problems I see with the software industry, in my opinion, is that projects are often given to people who don&amp;rsquo;t have enough contextual knowledge.This could be due to the fact that the industry is only two generations old and is currently experiencing a time of rapid expansion; alternatively, it could be that the industry has reached a mature stage if this problem has been resolved.</description>
