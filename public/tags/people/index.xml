      <title>Perhaps your main problem is not technology</title>

      <description>Right now, somewhere is suffering the disaster of another project of a wage calculation system&amp;hellip; And probably not alone.&#xA;Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you know, all project failures are usually blamed on technology. But was your task really so complex that the Java capabilities were not enough for it?&#xA;Projects are usually created by people, and it is these people that determine the success or failure of the whole project. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we need to think a little bit about how to help them succeed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about live coding in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Live Coding There&amp;rsquo;s always a lot of noise around him. Some people like it (interviews), some people don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all (candidates), and someone goes to a psychologist after him for six months. This is not really to understand that the candidate is able to code; there are not enough extensive projects on Github, profile articles with code, reports after all. As I was told, this is done to ensure that everyone is treated equally in recruitment. Well, good luck hiring a leader or a gentleman in five rounds. At the second, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask himself, &amp;ldquo;Do I really need this?</description>
