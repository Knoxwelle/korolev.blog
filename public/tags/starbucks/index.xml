      <description>Technophiles love precision â€“ especially programmers who live in a world of zeros and ones.They are used to working with binary decisions: one/zero, true/false, yes/no.Everything is clear and consistent; foreign key constraints, atomic transactions, and checksums protect against surprises.&#xA;Unfortunately, the real world is not so orderly.Clients place orders, and a second later, they cancel them.Receipts are rejected, letters are lost, payments are delayed, and promises are broken. Data entry errors occur more often than we would like.Users prefer &amp;ldquo;shallow&amp;rdquo; interfaces that provide simultaneous access to many functions, rather than a long and narrow corridor of the &amp;ldquo;process&amp;rdquo; of data entry, which is easier to implement and seems more &amp;ldquo;logical&amp;rdquo; to many developers. The execution of the program is now controlled not by the call stack, but by the user.</description>
