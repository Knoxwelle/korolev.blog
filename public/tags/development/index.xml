      <description>In the context of the development of corporate software applications, the architect should become a kind of bridge in the company between the business and technical communities, representing and defending the interests of both sides and often acting as a mediator between them, but at the same time allowing the business to control the affairs.When making technological decisions, the architect must be guided by the business objectives of the company and its surrounding realities.&#xA;Before undertaking a software development project, a commercial company usually plans and announces the desired return on investment (ROI).The architect must accept this indicator and the resulting limitations of the value of the product created for the company.This will help to avoid technical solutions that could lead to excessive expenditure.</description>

      <description>The collection has long ceased to play the role of the &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; in the design of projects.Both architects (both at the application level and at the corporate level) should encourage the use of continuous integration methods and tools in each project.&#xA;The term continuous integration (CI, Continuous Integration) was first proposed by Martin Fowler as a design template. It means a set of methods and tools that ensure regular automatic assembly and testing of applications over short intervals of time (usually on an integration server specially designed to perform these operations).For any modern software project, the practice of continuous integration, combining modular testing methods and tools with automated assembly tools, becomes mandatory.&#xA;Continuous integration affects an integral element of the software development process – the point of converting the source code into a working application.</description>
