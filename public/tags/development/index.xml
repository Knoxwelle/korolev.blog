      <description>When it comes to the creation of corporate software applications, the architect should serve as a sort of intermediary within the organization between the technical and business communities, representing and defending the interests of each while frequently mediating disputes and letting the business run its operations. The commercial goals of the organization and its external environment must inform the architect&amp;rsquo;s technological decisions.&#xA;A software development company typically plans and advertises the intended return on investment (ROI) prior to starting a software development project. This signal must be accepted by the architect, along with the ensuing restrictions on the product&amp;rsquo;s value for the business.This will assist in avoiding technological solutions that can result in exorbitant costs. When discussing the technical architecture and implementation with the development team, as well as when interacting with management (in the process of figuring out how to strike a balance between the cost and benefit of a given function), the return rate ought to play a significant role in the overall target context.</description>

      <description>The collection no longer serves as the project&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; in terms of design. In every project, architects should promote the use of continuous integration techniques and technologies, both at the corporate and application levels.&#xA;Martin Fowler originally suggested the term continuous integration (CI) as a design template. It refers to a collection of techniques and equipment that guarantees consistent, automated application testing and assembly across brief intervals of time (sometimes on an integration server specifically created to carry out these tasks). Continuous integration, which combines automated assembly tools with modular testing techniques and tools, is now required for all modern software projects.&#xA;The project&amp;rsquo;s components are now assembled and put to the test. These days, continuous integration has taken the position of &amp;ldquo;early and frequent assembly.</description>
