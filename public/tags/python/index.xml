      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time it is about testing knowledge in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Knowledge test So, I talked about five stages of IT interviews. You probably thought I exaggerated. But no: recruiter, Python test, live coding, system design, soft skills. Then another call for the offer presentation. So, the second stage is just some kind of Facebook spam. Not only can it be combined with live coding if it is not just to code but to discuss the solution, but also the questions on it, softly speaking, are stupid. Primitive and old-fashioned. So, according to the company&amp;rsquo;s logic, you can send soaps there, so you don&amp;rsquo;t waste your gentlemen&amp;rsquo;s time.</description>

      <description>Right now, somewhere is suffering the disaster of another project of a wage calculation system&amp;hellip; And probably not alone.&#xA;Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you know, all project failures are usually blamed on technology. But was your task really so complex that the Java capabilities were not enough for it?&#xA;Projects are usually created by people, and it is these people that determine the success or failure of the whole project. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we need to think a little bit about how to help them succeed.</description>
