      <description>For example, national air traffic coordination is a labor-intensive process. The control system needs to keep track of every aircraft&amp;rsquo;s precise location at all times, including height, speed, direction, and destination, in order to prevent collisions both in the air and on the runways. In addition, under constantly shifting circumstances, it&amp;rsquo;s imperative to quickly adjust aircraft schedules to avoid traffic bottlenecks at airports. A significant shift in the weather calls for a thorough reworking of the schedule.&#xA;On the other hand, unintended complexity arises from issues that we feel need to be handled in order to reduce the inherent complexity. A simple illustration of complexity is the flight management system, which is still in use even though it is outdated. The system was developed to manage the challenging task of coordinating the flight of thousands of aircraft; yet, this approach is not without its problems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few different programming projects. All of them encountered problems that turned out to be more difficult than the development team had predicted. This typically manifested itself in the following ways: although a minority of team members saw these problems at an early stage, most workers rejected or ignored any warning signs since they were too late to realize how serious they were.&#xA;This happens for a number of reasons:&#xA;-Project-related issues that don&amp;rsquo;t seem vital at first become crucial when it&amp;rsquo;s too late to fix them. The story of the welded frog is obviously a farce, but it well illustrates the mistakes that can be made in a lot of projects.&#xA;-When other team members don&amp;rsquo;t have the same level of skill or experience, some employees frequently encounter resistance.</description>
