      <description>If you look at any activity, process, or discipline with sufficient long distance, everything seems simple. Managers who have no experience software development, believe that the work of a programmer is simple, and programmers who have no management experience feel the same way about the work of a manager.&#xA;Programming is a certain activity that some people spend some of their time on. And the most difficult part of the work—the thought process—is the least noticeable and the least appreciated by the uninitiated. For decades, attempts have been made to eliminate the need for skilled thinking personnel. One of the earliest and most memorable attempts was Grace Hopper&amp;rsquo;s efforts to make programming languages less mysterious. Thanks to this, as some predicted, the need for narrowly specialized programmers may disappear.</description>

      <description>When testers and programmers start collaborating, miracles happen. Less time is spent playing ping-pong with defects in the defect tracking system. Less time is spent discussing whether the behavior is a bug or a new feature, and more time is spent on developing quality. software that meets customer expectations. There is many opportunities to establish collaboration even before the coding begins.&#xA;Testers can help clients write acceptance tests in the language their subject area using tools such as Fit (Framework for Интеграционный тест). If these tests are given to the programmers before they start writing code, they will be able to apply the practice of acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Programmers write frameworks to run the tests, and then code to ensure they pass. these tests.</description>

      <title>You need to take care of the code</title>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be Sherlock Holmes to understand that good programmers write good code. Well, the bad ones don&amp;rsquo;t. They create ugly things that everyone else has to clean up. But you want to write good code, right? Then you need to strive to become a good programmer.&#xA;Good code doesn&amp;rsquo;t just appear out of nowhere. Its emergence is not caused by the favorable alignment of the planets. To make the code good, you need to work on it, and quite a bit. You will create good code only when you truly strive for it. Good programming is not the result of mere technical competence. I have encountered very smart programmers who are capable of creating strong and impressive algorithms, know the standards of their language perfectly, and yet write completely terrible code.</description>
