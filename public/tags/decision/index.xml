      <description>People often think that making the best decision is what matters most when presented with options.This is untrue in design, whether it be software products or anything else. An analysis of the uncertainty in the system&amp;rsquo;s design is necessary when an alternative exists. Use breakdown and abstraction to lessen the significance of design decisions, or use uncertainty as a deciding factor to find areas where you can delay the transition to specifics.It&amp;rsquo;s conceivable that you&amp;rsquo;ll tie your hands later if you blindly &amp;ldquo;sew&amp;rdquo; whatever decision comes to mind into the system.As a result, the software product&amp;rsquo;s flexibility will decline and random judgments will start to take center stage.&#xA;Grady Booch provided one of the clearest and most helpful definitions of architecture, saying that &amp;ldquo;though not all designs are intended to result in architecture, all architecture is the product of design.</description>
