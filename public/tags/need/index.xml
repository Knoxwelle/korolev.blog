      <description>We have all fallen into “budget” refinements, when smart technological solutions are “buried” for savings.The conversation goes like this:&#xA;“Do we really need X?” the project sponsor asks.&#xA;In place of X you can replace virtually everything vital to the system: software licenses, surplus servers, external backups or power sources. The question is always asked in a native tone, as if you are dropping all your pocket money on comics and chewing, while serious adults need to think about buying new shells, in which they will drag their future profits.&#xA;The correct answer to this question is, &amp;ldquo;Yes. Absolutely necessary.&amp;rdquo; But for some reason, almost no one answers.&#xA;After all, we have technical education, and any technical discipline is the art of compromise.It is clear that no one will need exotic power sources if you put several white wheels in the data center and start interns in them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a bunch of programming projects.Each of them encountered problems that caused more trouble than the developer team expected.This often occurred as follows: some team members noticed such problems early, but most staff rejected or ignored all symptoms because they did not realize their importance until it was too late.&#xA;This happens for a variety of reasons:&#xA;Problems that seem trivial at an early stage of the project become critical when ix is too late to fix.The story of a welded frog is probably an exaggeration, but it perfectly illustrates what is happening in many projects.&#xA;Some employees often encounter resistance when other team members do not have similar experience or knowledge.Overcoming this resistance requires exceptional courage, confidence and persistence, and these qualities are rarely possessed even by highly paid experienced consultants hired specifically to prevent such problems.</description>
