      <description>A typical problem with many frameworks, class libraries, basic services and other infrastructure code is that they are designed for universal use, without attachment to specific applications. As a result, we get a staggering set of features and settings that are often not used at all or used for the wrong purpose, or even simply turned out to be useless.Most developers work on specific systems, and the pursuit of unlimited versatility rarely serves them well.The best way to universality lies through an in-depth understanding of known concrete examples and analysis of their essence in order to find a fundamental common solution: simplicity as a result of practical experience, rather than universality based on conjecture.&#xA;The priority of simplicity over versatility helps to make a choice between two architectural alternatives, equal in other respects.</description>
