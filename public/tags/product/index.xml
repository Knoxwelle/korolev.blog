      <description>The traditional technical processes that come to mind when creating a software architecture are breaking the system down into its component parts, defining interfaces, assigning tasks, using templates, and performance tuning. The architect also needs to consider a variety of additional factors, such as output management, deployment settings, simplicity of usage, safety, and ease of maintenance.All of these procedural and technical details, meanwhile, have to be pertinent to the needs of the stakeholders.One of the best ways to make sure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are comprehensive is to consider these interests during the requirements analysis process.&#xA;Each project participant has interests that impact the corporation as a whole as well as the software development process the company uses. The architect&amp;rsquo;s final set of priorities is derived from a consideration of these interests.</description>

      <title>Application performance determined by architecture</title>

      <description>The architecture of an application determines its performance. Although this claim appears clear at first glance, practical experience indicates otherwise. Software architects, for instance, frequently think that application performance issues can be resolved by simply moving to a different software infrastructure manufacturer. This notion could have its roots in the noise surrounding test results; for instance, claims that the leading company&amp;rsquo;s product performs 25% better than its closest rival&amp;rsquo;s could be the cause of this belief. However, given the overall low performance, which stems from architectural inefficiencies, the stated 25% (one millisection) means relatively little if the competition product completes the operation in 4 milliseconds and the leading product completes it in 3 milliseconds.&#xA;Other groups of people, like the developers&amp;rsquo; support service and the authors of the books on app performance management, advise you to perform the subtle configuration of the application&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, such as experimenting with memory allocation operations, connectivity pool sizes, flow pool sizes, and so forth, in addition to IT managers and performance testing teams.</description>
