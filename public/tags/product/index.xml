      <description>When designing a software architecture, the conventional technical procedures that spring to mind are disassembling the system into its constituent pieces, specifying interfaces, allocating responsibilities, employing templates, and optimizing performance. A wide range of other variables, including output management, deployment settings, convenience of use, safety, and maintenance, must also be taken into account by the architect.Meanwhile, every one of these technical and procedural specifics must be relevant to the requirements of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account during the requirements analysis process is one of the greatest ways to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are thorough.&#xA;Every project participant has interests that affect both the company&amp;rsquo;s software development process and the firm as a whole. Taking these interests into account leads to the architect&amp;rsquo;s final list of priorities.</description>

      <title>Application performance determined by architecture</title>

      <description>An application&amp;rsquo;s performance is determined by its architecture. On the surface, this claim seems obvious, but actual experience suggests otherwise. For example, software architects frequently believe that switching to a different software infrastructure manufacturer can alleviate application performance difficulties. This idea may have originated from the hype around test findings; for example, assertions that the product of the top company outperforms that of its nearest competitor by 25% may have contributed to the development of this view. However, if the leading product completes the operation in 3 milliseconds and the competitor product completes it in 4 milliseconds, the reported 25% (one millisection) represents virtually little given the overall low performance, which is caused by architectural inefficiencies.&#xA;In addition to IT managers and performance testing teams, other groups of people advise you to carry out the subtle configuration of the application&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, like experimenting with memory allocation operations, connectivity pool sizes, flow pool sizes, and so forth.</description>
