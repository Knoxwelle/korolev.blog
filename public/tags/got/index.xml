      <description>They may call themselves quality control or quality assurance, but many programmers simply call them a nuisance. My experience shows that programmers often have a hostile relationship with those who test their programs. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re too picky&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;They want everything to be perfect&amp;rdquo; are common complaints. Sound familiar?&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I have always had a different view on the work of testers. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because the &amp;ldquo;tester&amp;rdquo; at my first job in Canada was the firm&amp;rsquo;s secretary. A very pleasant lady who handled paperwork and tried to teach a couple of young programmers professional behavior in the presence of clients. She also had the gift of spotting any program defect, even the most inconspicuous, in a matter of seconds.&#xA;At that time, I was working on a program written by an accountant who considered herself a programmer.</description>
