      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations.

You probably thought I exaggerated. But no: recruiter, Python test, live coding, system design, soft skills. Then another call for the offer presentation. So, the second stage is just some kind of Facebook spam. Not only can it be combined with live coding if it is not just to code but to discuss the solution, but also the questions on it, softly speaking, are stupid. Primitive and old-fashioned. So, according to the company&amp;rsquo;s logic, you can send soaps there, so you don&amp;rsquo;t waste your gentlemen&amp;rsquo;s time.</description>
