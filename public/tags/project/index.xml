      <description>Right now, somewhere is suffering the disaster of another project of a wage calculation system&amp;hellip; And probably not alone. Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you know, all project failures are usually blamed on technology. But was your task really so complex that the Java capabilities were not enough for it? Projects are usually created by people, and it is these people that determine the success or failure of the whole project. And once that&amp;rsquo;s the case, we need to think a little bit about how to help them succeed.</description>

      <description>We, technicians, choose to use certain technologies, methodologies and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the optimal solution, but only because in the depths of our heart we want to mention them in our summary. Such a choice very rarely leads to a positive result. The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client.</description>
