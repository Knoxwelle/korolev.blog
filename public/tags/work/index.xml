      <title>Сделать наспех и сбежать это преступление</title>

      <description>Time is approaching evening.The command is friendly about the new functionality scheduled for the current iteration; it seems that even the air in the room is pulsing at a working pace.However, John is a little in a hurry: he is waiting for a date.However, he has time to rewrite his part of the code, compiles it, registers in the source code management system – and rushes away.A few minutes later, the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; is lit: the assembly of the app is disrupted.John didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he acted on the rush and run principle, causing the entire team to stall.&#xA;The situation has changed – the working rhythm has failed. Now everyone knows that when you update the code from the version control system, the code will not work on their local computers, and because the team will have to integrate a lot of code to prepare for the upcoming demonstration, this becomes a serious obstacle.</description>

      <title>Knowledge test</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time it is about testing knowledge in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Knowledge test So, I talked about five stages of IT interviews. You probably thought I exaggerated. But no: recruiter, Python test, live coding, system design, soft skills. Then another call for the offer presentation. So, the second stage is just some kind of Facebook spam. Not only can it be combined with live coding if it is not just to code but to discuss the solution, but also the questions on it, softly speaking, are stupid. Primitive and old-fashioned. So, according to the company&amp;rsquo;s logic, you can send soaps there, so you don&amp;rsquo;t waste your gentlemen&amp;rsquo;s time.</description>

      <title>Never prioritize your resume over the needs of the client</title>

      <description>We, technicians, choose to use certain technologies, methodologies and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the optimal solution, but only because in the depths of our heart we want to mention them in our summary. Such a choice very rarely leads to a positive result.&#xA;The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client.</description>

      <title>Live Coding</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/live-coding/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about live coding in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Live Coding There&amp;rsquo;s always a lot of noise around him. Some people like it (interviews), some people don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all (candidates), and someone goes to a psychologist after him for six months. This is not really to understand that the candidate is able to code; there are not enough extensive projects on Github, profile articles with code, reports after all. As I was told, this is done to ensure that everyone is treated equally in recruitment. Well, good luck hiring a leader or a gentleman in five rounds. At the second, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask himself, &amp;ldquo;Do I really need this?</description>
