      <description>As technicians, we choose particular strategies, technologies, and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the greatest answer, but rather because we genuinely wish to incorporate them into our overview. Choosing such a course of action rarely pays off.&#xA;Your grateful clients who are lining up to recommend you to others will be the most effective career catalyst because of how well you have served them. The gracious customers will provide you with greater service than any recently developed paradigm or in-vogue item in the new language. Architects need to stay up to date on evolving concepts and technologies, but you should never try to take on additional work at the client&amp;rsquo;s expense. It is imperative for architects to always remember that their organization&amp;rsquo;s success is their responsibility.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s almost evening. The command is nice about the new features planned for the present iteration; even the room seems to be pulsing at a working rate. However, John is a little hurried because he&amp;rsquo;s waiting for a date. There&amp;rsquo;s still time for him to dash off, rework his part of the code, build it, and upload it to the source code repository. The &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; illuminates, and the app&amp;rsquo;s construction is interrupted after a few minutes. John acted precipitously, believing that his lack of time for automated tests would force the team to stall.&#xA;The situation has changed; the working rhythm has failed. Now everyone knows that when they update the code from the version control system, it will break on their own computers.</description>
