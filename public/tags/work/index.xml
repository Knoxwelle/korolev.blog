      <description>Evening is drawing near. Even the air in the room seems to be pulsing at a working pace; the command is pleasant regarding the new features planned for the current iteration. But John is waiting for a date, so he&amp;rsquo;s a touch rushed. He still has time to rush off, rewrite his portion of the code, build it, and register it in the source code management system. After a few minutes, the app&amp;rsquo;s assembly is disrupted, and the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; is lit.John acted rashly, assuming that the team would stall because he didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests.&#xA;The working rhythm has failed; the circumstances have altered. Everyone is now aware that updating the code from the version control system will cause it to malfunction on their local machines.</description>

      <description>As technicians, we select specific technologies, tactics, and methods to address issues not because they offer the best solution but rather because we sincerely want to include them in our synopsis. Making such a decision almost never has favorable outcomes.&#xA;Because you have done so successfully for them, your grateful clients who are waiting in line to refer you to others will be the most potent career catalyst. You will get better service from the kind clients than from any newly created paradigm or trendy object in the new language. Even though staying current with emerging ideas and technology is crucial for architects, you should never try to take on more work at the client&amp;rsquo;s expense. As architects, you should never forget that you are responsible for the success of your organization.</description>
