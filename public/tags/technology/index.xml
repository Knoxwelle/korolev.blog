      <description>As technicians, we select specific technologies, tactics, and methods to address issues not because they offer the best solution but rather because we sincerely want to include them in our synopsis. Making such a decision almost never has favorable outcomes.&#xA;Because you have done so successfully for them, your grateful clients who are waiting in line to refer you to others will be the most potent career catalyst. You will get better service from the kind clients than from any newly created paradigm or trendy object in the new language. Even though staying current with emerging ideas and technology is crucial for architects, you should never try to take on more work at the client&amp;rsquo;s expense. As architects, you should never forget that you are responsible for the success of your organization.</description>
