      <description>We, technicians, choose to use certain technologies, methodologies and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the optimal solution, but only because in the depths of our heart we want to mention them in our summary. Such a choice very rarely leads to a positive result.&#xA;The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others â€“ because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client.</description>
