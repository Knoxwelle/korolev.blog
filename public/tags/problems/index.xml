      <description>There are several reasons why a software project might not succeed. One of the most common reasons projects fail is modifying the work schedule in the middle of the project without adequate planning. These kinds of failures can be avoided, but it will require a large team effort to do so. Changes to a project&amp;rsquo;s schedule or resource allocation usually don&amp;rsquo;t result in any problems. Problems occur when you have to work longer hours in the same amount of time or shorten the schedule without reducing the task.&#xA;The myth that you may shorten the schedule to save costs or speed product delivery is one that is widely held. More hours are typically put in, or &amp;ldquo;less important tasks&amp;rdquo; (such as modular testing) are abandoned in order to produce a product faster or with better functionality that doesn&amp;rsquo;t delay delivery.</description>

      <description>Code never lies, but it can be internally contradictory. Sometimes contradictions cause confusion: how can this even work?&#xA;In his interview, Allan Klumpp, the lead software developer for the Apollo lunar module, revealed that the engine control software contained a defect that caused the lunar module to behave erratically. However, there was another bug in the program that compensated for the first one, and during the Apollo 11 and 12 moon landings, this software was successfully used before the bugs were discovered and fixed.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a function that returns an exit code. Let&amp;rsquo;s say it returns false when it should return true. Now imagine that the calling function does not implement the check for the return value. Everything works perfectly until one day someone discovers the lack of a check and adds it.</description>
