      <description>I patted three programmers on the shoulder and asked what they were working on. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m refactoring these methods,&amp;rdquo; was the first one&amp;rsquo;s reply. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m adding some parameters to this web operation,&amp;rdquo; said the second. The third one said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m working on this use case.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It may seem that the first two were absorbed in the details of their work, and only the third saw the bigger picture, and his approach was better. I asked when and what they were going to put in the repository, and then the picture changed dramatically. The first two clearly understood what files they would be, and were going to finish the work in about an hour. The third said, &amp;ldquo;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll finish in a few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add some classes and somehow modify the services.</description>

      <description>Store everything related to any of your projects in a version control system. The necessary resources are already available: free tools like Subversion, Git, Mercurial, and CVS, ample disk space, cheap and powerful servers, ubiquitous Internet access, and even project hosting services. Once you have installed the version control system, saving your work in the repository is very simple: just execute the corresponding command in the clean directory with the code. And you only need to master two new basic operations: committing (commit) changes you made in the code to the repository, and updating (update) your working version of the project to the one in the repository.&#xA;Once the project is placed in the version control system, you can easily view its history, find out who wrote each piece of code, and refer to a specific version of a file or project using a unique identifier.</description>
