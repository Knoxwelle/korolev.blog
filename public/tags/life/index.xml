      <description>You can ask 100 different people what any programmer should know and be able to do, and get 100 different answers. This can be both overwhelming and frightening. All advice is good, all principles are sound, all stories are convincing, but where to start? And, more importantly, once you start applying best practices, how do you maintain the right level and make them an integral part of your programming practice?&#xA;I think the answer lies in your mindset or simply in your approach. If you are indifferent to your fellow developers, testers, managers, sales and marketing staff, as well as end users, you will not feel the urge to, for example, conduct test-driven development or write clear comments in the code. I think there is a simple way to change your attitude and develop a desire to release products of the highest quality:</description>

      <description>Store everything related to any of your projects in a version control system. The necessary resources are already available: free tools like Subversion, Git, Mercurial, and CVS, ample disk space, cheap and powerful servers, ubiquitous Internet access, and even project hosting services. Once you have installed the version control system, saving your work in the repository is very simple: just execute the corresponding command in the clean directory with the code. And you only need to master two new basic operations: committing (commit) changes you made in the code to the repository, and updating (update) your working version of the project to the one in the repository.&#xA;Once the project is placed in the version control system, you can easily view its history, find out who wrote each piece of code, and refer to a specific version of a file or project using a unique identifier.</description>
