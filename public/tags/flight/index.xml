      <description>For instance, it takes a lot of work to coordinate air traffic at the national level. To avoid collisions in the air and on the runways, the control system must continuously monitor each aircraft&amp;rsquo;s exact location, including height, speed, direction, and destination. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s critical to swiftly manage aircraft schedules in order to prevent traffic jams at airports under continuously changing conditions. A drastic change in the weather necessitates a complete revision of the timetable.&#xA;Conversely, problems that we believe must be resolved in order to lessen the inherent complexity are the source of unintended complexity. A modest example of complexity is the flight management system, which is now out of date and yet in use.The system was created to handle the difficult task of coordinating the flight of thousands of aircraft; however, this solution has drawbacks of its own.</description>
