      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fast&amp;rdquo; can&amp;rsquo;t be a requirement.As well as having a good response time.Or, say, &amp;ldquo;expandable.&amp;ldquo;The main reason is the lack of objective criteria for meeting such requirements.But users still need these features. The task of the architect is to ensure that the system has the necessary qualities, as well as to balance the inevitable contradictions that arise between them.Without objective criteria, the architect depends on the customer’s caprices (“No, I can’t accept the program – it doesn’t work fast enough”) and on the developers obsessed with obsessive ideas (“no, the program is not ready – it isn’t working fast enough”).&#xA;Usually we try to write down all such wishes, as well as any other requirements. But this entry very often looks like a set of foggy epithetics: “flexible”, “friendly to accompany” and so on.</description>
