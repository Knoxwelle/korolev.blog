      <description>Upon being drawn to the project, the architect&amp;rsquo;s urge to &amp;ldquo;show himself&amp;rdquo; is evident.The hiring of a software architect typically signifies the organization&amp;rsquo;s trust in the expert&amp;rsquo;s technical proficiency; thus, the architect aspires to promptly demonstrate his merit for the trust. Unfortunately, there are those among us who mistakenly think that in order to &amp;ldquo;imagine yourself in all its glory,&amp;rdquo; one must shock, if not completely obscure, the group with their technical brilliance.&#xA;While making an impact on the audience is crucial for marketing, it has a detrimental effect on program project management. By taking a responsible leadership stance and having a solid grasp of both the technical and substantive aspects of the challenge at hand, the architect can gain the respect of his team.</description>
