      <description>A good architect should set the example. In addition to performing performance tests and developing modular tests, he should be able to take on any role within the team and manage any activity, including networking configuration and assembly process management. When it comes to not having a complete understanding of every technology that is out there, an architect is just like any other project manager. While it&amp;rsquo;s common for team members to possess greater expertise in their specialized fields, they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to put their trust in their architect if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the technology being used.As was already noted, an architect acts as a liaison between the technical team and the firm; thus, in order to represent the team to the business management without constantly asking for help, he needs to be well-versed in all technical aspects.</description>

      <description>When it comes to developing corporate software applications, the architect should act as a kind of go-between for the technical and business communities inside the organization, representing and defending each group&amp;rsquo;s interests, resolving conflicts on a regular basis, and allowing the business to operate as usual. The architect&amp;rsquo;s technology choices must take the organization&amp;rsquo;s business objectives and external surroundings into consideration.&#xA;Before beginning a software development project, a software development business usually plans and promotes the desired return on investment (ROI). The architect has to acknowledge this signal and the resulting limitations on the product&amp;rsquo;s business value.This will help prevent the need of technical solutions that could be extremely expensive. The return rate should be taken into consideration in the overall target context when talking about the technical architecture and implementation with the development team and when interacting with management (during the process of determining how to strike a balance between the cost and benefit of a given function).</description>
