      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about Screening in enterprise companies, and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Screening It all starts with it, and tech-screening becomes the norm. Recruiter directly on the first call asks cavernous questions and checks with sparkling. For example:&#xA;how to stop the container? unchanged data typesx in python? What&amp;rsquo;s the PID of the Linux kernel? how do you decipher CAP and PACELC? &amp;hellip; Some of them go even further and create an entire platform with small pieces of code that can be run. 20 questions in 20 minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; Well, he knows, I&amp;rsquo;t just miss that code on a review, because it&amp;rsquo;s wild.</description>
