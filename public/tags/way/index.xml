      <description>A good architect should set an example to others. He should be able to replace any member of his team and do anything from networking and configuring the assembly process to writing modular tests and performing performance tests. Without a good understanding of the entire range of technologies, an architect is little different from an ordinary project manager.Team members may have deeper knowledge in their narrow fields – this is perfectly normal – but they are unlikely to be able to trust their architect unless he is familiar with the technologies used.As has already been said, an architect is an interface between the technical team and the business, which means that he must understand all the technical aspects in order to play the role of the team representative before the business management, without constantly seeking help.</description>
