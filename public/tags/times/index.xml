      <description>A software project can fail for many reasons.One of the most common sources of project failure is changing the schedule of work during the project execution without proper planning.Such failures can be avoided, but it requires considerable effort on the part of many people.Adjusting the timescale or adding resources to a project usually does not create any problems.Problems start when you are required to do more work in the same timeframe or shorten the schedule without reducing the load.&#xA;The idea that by shortening the schedule you can reduce costs or speed up the delivery of a product is a very common misconception.Typically, overtime is used or &amp;ldquo;less important tasks&amp;rdquo; (such as modular testing) are sacrificed for faster delivery of the product or for enhanced functionality without changing the delivery time.</description>
