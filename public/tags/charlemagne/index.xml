      <description>Programmers need to communicate. And communicate a lot.&#xA;In a programmer&amp;rsquo;s life, there are periods when communication mainly occurs with the computer—more precisely, with the programs running on it. This communication is based on expressing ideas in a form understandable to the machine. The ability to turn ideas into reality through programs and with almost no use of physical matter still evokes delight.&#xA;A programmer must be fluent in machine language—real or virtual—and the abstractions that can be linked to this language using developer tools. It is important to know many different abstractions; otherwise, some ideas are very difficult to express. A good programmer should be able to go beyond everyday routines and recognize that there are other languages that are more expressive for other tasks.</description>
