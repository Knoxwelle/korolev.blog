      <description>For example, national air traffic coordination is a labor-intensive process. The control system needs to keep track of every aircraft&amp;rsquo;s precise location at all times, including height, speed, direction, and destination, in order to prevent collisions both in the air and on the runways. In addition, under constantly shifting circumstances, it&amp;rsquo;s imperative to quickly adjust aircraft schedules to avoid traffic bottlenecks at airports. A significant shift in the weather calls for a thorough reworking of the schedule.&#xA;On the other hand, unintended complexity arises from issues that we feel need to be handled in order to reduce the inherent complexity. A simple illustration of complexity is the flight management system, which is still in use even though it is outdated. The system was developed to manage the challenging task of coordinating the flight of thousands of aircraft; yet, this approach is not without its problems.</description>
