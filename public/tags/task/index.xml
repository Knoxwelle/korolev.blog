      <description>I patted three programmers on the shoulder and asked what they were working on. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m refactoring these methods,&amp;rdquo; was the first one&amp;rsquo;s reply. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m adding some parameters to this web operation,&amp;rdquo; said the second. The third one said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m working on this use case.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It may seem that the first two were absorbed in the details of their work, and only the third saw the bigger picture, and his approach was better. I asked when and what they were going to put in the repository, and then the picture changed dramatically. The first two clearly understood what files they would be, and were going to finish the work in about an hour. The third said, &amp;ldquo;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll finish in a few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add some classes and somehow modify the services.</description>

      <description>I have yet to meet a client who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be happy to tell me what they need â€“ usually down to the smallest details. The problem is that clients don&amp;rsquo;t always tell the whole truth. Overall, clients don&amp;rsquo;t lie, but they speak in their own client language, not in the language of developers. They have their own vocabulary and their own context. They leave out important details. They talk as if you have also worked in their company for twenty years. And it is all complicated by the fact that, in reality, clients often don&amp;rsquo;t know what they need! Some have an understanding of the big picture, but they are rarely able to articulate their vision clearly. For others, the overall picture may be less vivid, but they know what they don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description>
