      <description>I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.&#xA;Examining Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:&#xA;-How is it possible to halt the container? The original data types in Python? What is the PID of the Linux kernel? How are PACELC and CAP understood?&#xA;-&amp;hellip; Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. &amp;ldquo;How do I send a message to the generator?&amp;rdquo; Or even &amp;ldquo;What does this code do?&amp;rdquo; He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just ignore it in a review.</description>

      <description>Nearly all architects begin their professional lives as developers. Although the architect has more duties, he also has more say over how the system is designed. It will be hard for you to give up some of your programming habits in your new work as an architect. Even worse, you might think that in order to put your concept into practice, you have to keep an eye on the developers and everything they do. But it&amp;rsquo;s critical for your success—as well as the success of your team—to provide each of your coworkers with enough autonomy to showcase their abilities and originality.&#xA;It is rare for a developer to have time to sit down and consider the overall coherence of the system. The architect should give this their whole attention at the same time.</description>
