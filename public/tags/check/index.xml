      <description>You cover all the finished code or its fragments with automated tests. Congratulations! Do you write tests first and then code? Even better! Just because of this, you can be considered a programmer practicing advanced approaches in software development. But are your tests good? How can you determine that? One way is to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;Who am I writing for?&amp;rdquo; these tests?Â». If the answer is &amp;ldquo;I write them for myself to reduce costs for debugging&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;for the compiler to execute them,&amp;rdquo; then it&amp;rsquo;s quite possible that you are not writing the best tests. So, for whom Why write tests? For those who will try to understand your code.&#xA;Good tests serve as documentation for the code they are testing. They describe how the code works.</description>
