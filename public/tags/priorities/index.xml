      <description>When it comes to developing a software architecture, we first imagine the classic technical operations: system breakdown into modules, defining interfaces, allocating responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance.In addition, the architect must take into account a number of other aspects, including safety, ease of use, easy maintenance, output management, choice of deployment settings, etc.However, all of these technical and procedural aspects must be relevant to the needs of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account in the analysis of requirements is a great way to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are complete.&#xA;All parties involved in the project have interests affecting both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole. It is the analysis of these interests that forms the resulting set of priorities for the architect.</description>
