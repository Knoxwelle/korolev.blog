      <description>Less is more. It&amp;rsquo;s a clichéd short maxim, but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s really true.&#xA;Over the past few weeks, among the improvements I made to our code was the removal of some of its fragments.&#xA;We were developing the project following the principles of extreme programming, including YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It). But human nature is imperfect, and in some places we made mistakes.&#xA;I noticed that our product took an unjustifiably long time to perform certain tasks—simple tasks that should have been completed almost instantly. This was all because we overcomplicated their implementation—with all sorts of trinkets and bows that were actually unnecessary but seemed useful at some point.&#xA;So, I simplified the code, improved the product&amp;rsquo;s performance, and reduced the overall code entropy, all thanks to removing unnecessary functions from the project code.</description>
