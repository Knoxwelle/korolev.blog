      <description>In terms of design, the collection is no longer the &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; for the project. Architects must encourage the implementation of continuous integration methodologies and technology in all projects, at the corporate and application levels.&#xA;The term continuous integration (CI) was first proposed by Martin Fowler as a design template. It describes a set of methods and tools that ensure reliable, automated application testing and assembly across short time intervals (often on an integration server designed to do these functions). These days, all software projects must use continuous integration, which blends automated assembly tools with modular testing methods and resources.&#xA;Now that the project&amp;rsquo;s components have been assembled, they have been tested. Continuous integration now occupies the space previously occupied by &amp;ldquo;early and frequent assembly.</description>
