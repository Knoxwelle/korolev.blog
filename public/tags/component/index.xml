      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common to compare software development to constructing highways, dams, and skyscrapers. This analogy makes sense in a few key areas.&#xA;The intricacy of the construction process is more challenging than designing a structure that will remain in its final location when it is built.This technique will result in a ready-made building at the end from an empty site at the start. Every employee should be able to use their professional abilities throughout this time, and the partially constructed structure should hold together. This comparison has practical implications for large-scale integrated system implementation. (And almost all web and business apps fall under the &amp;ldquo;integrated&amp;rdquo; category!) The classic &amp;ldquo;Big Bang&amp;rdquo; deployment involves bringing a large number of beams into the desert, launching them into the air, and then waiting for the beams to self-assemble into a building.</description>
