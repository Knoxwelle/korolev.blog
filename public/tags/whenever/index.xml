      <description>We architects are interested in learning how good the software we are developing is.There is a more subtle internal component to program quality that has to do with the design&amp;rsquo;s clarity, or how simple it is for us to comprehend, support, and grow the software product. The exterior component of program quality is evident: the program must be valuable to the user. Whenever we push for a definition of quality, we ultimately say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll know when I see it.&amp;rdquo; So, what do you think quality is?&#xA;Architectural charts use small squares to represent entire systems, and the lines that connect them can indicate any number of things, including shared resources (like a train) or dependencies. These diagrams show the system at a 10-kilometer altitude, which is roughly equivalent to how an airplane views the terrain.</description>
