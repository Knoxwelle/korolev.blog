      <description>Imagine that you are completely absorbed in your work: focused, passionate, and busy. You have lost track of time. You are happy. You are in a state of flow. On a larger scale, it is difficult for an entire team of developers to achieve and maintain a state of flow due to numerous interruptions, distractions, and other obstacles that can easily disrupt it.&#xA;If you have already participated in pair programming, you probably know how it contributes to achieving a state of flow. If not, we want to share our experience to encourage you to start pair programming immediately! For pair programming to be successful, some effort is required from individual team members and the entire team as a whole.&#xA;Being part of a team, show patience towards less experienced developers.</description>
