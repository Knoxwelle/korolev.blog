      <description>An application&amp;rsquo;s performance is determined by its architecture. On the surface, this claim seems obvious, but actual experience suggests otherwise. For example, software architects frequently believe that switching to a different software infrastructure manufacturer can alleviate application performance difficulties. This idea may have originated from the hype around test findings; for example, assertions that the product of the top company outperforms that of its nearest competitor by 25% may have contributed to the development of this view. However, if the leading product completes the operation in 3 milliseconds and the competitor product completes it in 4 milliseconds, the reported 25% (one millisection) represents virtually little given the overall low performance, which is caused by architectural inefficiencies.&#xA;In addition to IT managers and performance testing teams, other groups of people advise you to carry out the subtle configuration of the application&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, like experimenting with memory allocation operations, connectivity pool sizes, flow pool sizes, and so forth.</description>
