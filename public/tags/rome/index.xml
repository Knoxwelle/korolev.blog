      <description>In ancient Rome, Janus was considered the god of beginnings and endings, doors and passages.He was usually depicted with two heads facing in different directions; this symbol is often found on coins and in films.Janus symbolizes transitions and changes in life – birth, marriage, reaching maturity – from the past to the future, from youth to old age.&#xA;Janus&amp;rsquo;s ability to look both forward and backward, to see the past and the future, is an exceptionally valuable skill for both a software architect and a building architect.The architect strives to unite reality with their vision of it, past achievements with future plans, and management expectations with development constraints.Building such bridges is a crucial part of an architect&amp;rsquo;s work.Often, an architect feels that in their pursuit to bring a project to completion, they must overcome chasms created by forces pulling in opposite directions.</description>
