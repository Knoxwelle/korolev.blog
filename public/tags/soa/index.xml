      <description>Every software architect should know and understand that you can&amp;rsquo;t get everything at once. In practice, it is impossible to design an architecture that has high performance, high availability, high security and high abstraction at the same time.There is one real story that software architects need to know, understand and tell their clients and colleagues.I mean the history of the Vaza.&#xA;In 1620, there was a war between Sweden and Poland. Wishing to put an end to this expensive war more quickly, the King of Sweden ordered the construction of a gallion called the Vase.It was an unusual ship.The requirements for it were not the same as for any other ship of the time.It was to be more than 60 metres long, carry 64 guns on two battery deck, and also carry 300 soldiers at a time for safe delivery to Poland by sea.</description>
