      <description>When it comes to developing a software architecture, we first imagine the classic technical operations: system breakdown into modules, defining interfaces, allocating responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance.In addition, the architect must take into account a number of other aspects, including safety, ease of use, easy maintenance, output management, choice of deployment settings, etc.However, all of these technical and procedural aspects must be relevant to the needs of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account in the analysis of requirements is a great way to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are complete.&#xA;All parties involved in the project have interests affecting both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole. It is the analysis of these interests that forms the resulting set of priorities for the architect.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about system design enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;System Design In senior grades, another type of interview appears—system design. In one hour you have to design systems, thinking about the architecture of which in a real project you would spend several weeks. IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, BPMN—forget these scary words; there&amp;rsquo;s no time for them. Figac-figac and Proudakshen. Requirements collection -&amp;gt; usage options -&amp;gt; system requirements -&amp;gt; processing -&amp;gt; presentation of the solution, time has passed. The main thing here is more basic words: to build a smart face and somewhere to put kafka. Then they&amp;rsquo;ll be behind you in 40 minutes.</description>
