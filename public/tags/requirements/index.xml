      <description>When designing a software architecture, the conventional technical procedures that spring to mind are disassembling the system into its constituent pieces, specifying interfaces, allocating responsibilities, employing templates, and optimizing performance. A wide range of other variables, including output management, deployment settings, convenience of use, safety, and maintenance, must also be taken into account by the architect.Meanwhile, every one of these technical and procedural specifics must be relevant to the requirements of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account during the requirements analysis process is one of the greatest ways to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are thorough.&#xA;Every project participant has interests that affect both the company&amp;rsquo;s software development process and the firm as a whole. Taking these interests into account leads to the architect&amp;rsquo;s final list of priorities.</description>

      <title>Success is hampered by scale</title>

      <description>The scope of the project is defined by its boundaries.How much time, energy, and money are needed to put it into practice? What degree of quality and usefulness are necessary? To what extent is meeting the deadline for product delivery a challenge? What kind of danger exists? What are the boundaries? The project&amp;rsquo;s boundaries are established by the responses to these queries. Large-scale, intricate projects present a challenge that software architects relish. People are even tempted to inflate the project&amp;rsquo;s size in order to give the impression that it is more important due to the prospective rewards.However, because the chance of failure is increasing more quickly than anticipated, expanding borders is the enemy of success. An order of magnitude increase in project scale typically translates into an increased risk of failure.</description>
