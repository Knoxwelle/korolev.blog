      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been &amp;ldquo;buried&amp;rdquo; for savings through ingenious technological &amp;ldquo;budget&amp;rdquo; changes.The conversation goes like this:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Is X really necessary?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;X can replace nearly anything that is required for the system, such as additional servers, software licenses, external backups, and power supplies. The question is always asked in a casual tone, as if you are spending your entire allowance on gum and comic books, and older people ought to think about buying new shells to save their money for the future.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; is the right answer to this question. absolutely necessary.&amp;quot; However, almost no one answers, for whatever reason.&#xA;After all, we have technical education, and every technical occupation requires the ability to compromise.It is evident that nobody will need unconventional power sources if several white wheels are installed in the data center and interns are stationed there.</description>
