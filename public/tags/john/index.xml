      <description>Time is approaching evening.The command is friendly about the new functionality scheduled for the current iteration; it seems that even the air in the room is pulsing at a working pace.However, John is a little in a hurry: he is waiting for a date.However, he has time to rewrite his part of the code, compiles it, registers in the source code management system – and rushes away.A few minutes later, the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; is lit: the assembly of the app is disrupted.John didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he acted on the rush and run principle, causing the entire team to stall.&#xA;The situation has changed – the working rhythm has failed. Now everyone knows that when you update the code from the version control system, the code will not work on their local computers, and because the team will have to integrate a lot of code to prepare for the upcoming demonstration, this becomes a serious obstacle.</description>
