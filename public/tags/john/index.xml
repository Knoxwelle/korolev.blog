      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s getting close to evening. The team is diligently working on the new functionality planned for the current iteration; it seems even the air in the room is pulsing with the rhythm of work. However, John is a bit in a hurry: he has a date waiting for him. However, he manages to finish writing his part of the code, compiles it, registers it in the version control system – and hastily leaves. A few minutes later, the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; comes on: the application build is broken. John didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he went with the &amp;ldquo;hack and run&amp;rdquo; principle, which caused the entire team&amp;rsquo;s work to come to a halt.&#xA;The situation has changed – the work rhythm has been disrupted.</description>
