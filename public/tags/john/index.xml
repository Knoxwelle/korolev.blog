      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s almost evening. The command is nice about the new features planned for the present iteration; even the room seems to be pulsing at a working rate. However, John is a little hurried because he&amp;rsquo;s waiting for a date. There&amp;rsquo;s still time for him to dash off, rework his part of the code, build it, and upload it to the source code repository. The &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; illuminates, and the app&amp;rsquo;s construction is interrupted after a few minutes. John acted precipitously, believing that his lack of time for automated tests would force the team to stall.&#xA;The situation has changed; the working rhythm has failed. Now everyone knows that when they update the code from the version control system, it will break on their own computers.</description>
