      <description>Error messages are the most critical form of interaction between the user and the system. They arise when the user&amp;rsquo;s communication with the system is on the verge of breaking down.&#xA;It is easiest to assume that errors occur due to user fault from entering incorrect data. However, the mistakes people make are predictable and happen systematically. Therefore, you can &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; the interaction between the user and the system just as you debug the interaction between other components of the system.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say the user needs to enter a date within a specific range. Instead of allowing them to enter any date, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to provide a tool like a list or calendar that shows only the permissible dates? This would eliminate any possibility of entering a date outside the allowed range.</description>
