      <description>There are several reasons why a software project might not succeed. One of the most common reasons projects fail is modifying the work schedule in the middle of the project without adequate planning. These kinds of failures can be avoided, but it will require a large team effort to do so. Changes to a project&amp;rsquo;s schedule or resource allocation usually don&amp;rsquo;t result in any problems. Problems occur when you have to work longer hours in the same amount of time or shorten the schedule without reducing the task.&#xA;The myth that you may shorten the schedule to save costs or speed product delivery is one that is widely held. More hours are typically put in, or &amp;ldquo;less important tasks&amp;rdquo; (such as modular testing) are abandoned in order to produce a product faster or with better functionality that doesn&amp;rsquo;t delay delivery.</description>
