      <description>Functional requirements are where business application users&amp;rsquo; needs are mostly expressed. The architect is in charge of the system&amp;rsquo;s non-functional elements, which include performance, flexibility, downtime, support requirements, etc. Simultaneously, initial testing of non-functional needs is sometimes completely assigned to the system maintenance team or delayed until a very late point in the development cycle.&#xA;This is a far more frequent error than it ought to be. It may be founded on a number of factors.It may seem futile to worry about the program&amp;rsquo;s speed and adaptability when it isn&amp;rsquo;t precisely fulfilling the necessary role yet. Both the test settings and the tests themselves are highly intricate. Due to low use intensity, early working versions of the system might not have been subjected to a realistic load.</description>
