      <description>The needs of users of business applications manifest primarily in functional requirements. Non-functional aspects of the system (such as performance, flexibility, downtime, support needs, etc.) are in the architect’s hands. At the same time, preliminary testing of non-functional requirements is often postponed to a very late stage of the development cycle and sometimes fully delegated to the system maintenance team.&#xA;This mistake is much more common than it should be. It can be based on various reasons.Worrying about the speed and flexibility of the program, which is not yet exactly performing the required function, may seem pointless. Test environments and tests themselves are quite complex.Early working versions of the system may not be exposed to a realistic load due to insufficient intensity of use.</description>
