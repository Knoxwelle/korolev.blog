      <description>Have you ever seen a list of compiler warnings the size of an essay on how not to write code and thought: &amp;ldquo;Of course, something needs to be done about this&amp;hellip; but I just don&amp;rsquo;t have time for it right now&amp;rdquo;? And conversely, have you ever seen a single warning appear during compilation and immediately fix it?&#xA;When I start a new project from scratch, there are no warnings, no mess, no problems. But as the codebase grows, if no measures are taken, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that the mess, clutter, warnings, and issues will gradually accumulate. In a large stream of &amp;ldquo;noise,&amp;rdquo; it becomes significantly harder to find a truly important warning among the hundreds of others that I am not interested in.&#xA;To make warnings useful again, I try to adhere to a policy of zero tolerance for warnings during assembly.</description>
