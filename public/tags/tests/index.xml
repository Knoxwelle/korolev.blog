      <title>To do something hastily and run away is a crime</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s getting close to evening. The team is diligently working on the new functionality planned for the current iteration; it seems even the air in the room is pulsing with the rhythm of work. However, John is a bit in a hurry: he has a date waiting for him. However, he manages to finish writing his part of the code, compiles it, registers it in the version control system – and hastily leaves. A few minutes later, the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; comes on: the application build is broken. John didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests, so he went with the &amp;ldquo;hack and run&amp;rdquo; principle, which caused the entire team&amp;rsquo;s work to come to a halt.&#xA;The situation has changed – the work rhythm has been disrupted.</description>

      <description>You cover all the finished code or its fragments with automated tests. Congratulations! Do you write tests first and then code? Even better! Just because of this, you can be considered a programmer practicing advanced approaches in software development. But are your tests good? How can you determine that? One way is to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;Who am I writing for?&amp;rdquo; these tests?». If the answer is &amp;ldquo;I write them for myself to reduce costs for debugging&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;for the compiler to execute them,&amp;rdquo; then it&amp;rsquo;s quite possible that you are not writing the best tests. So, for whom Why write tests? For those who will try to understand your code.&#xA;Good tests serve as documentation for the code they are testing. They describe how the code works.</description>

      <title>When programmers and testers collaborate</title>

      <description>When testers and programmers start collaborating, miracles happen. Less time is spent playing ping-pong with defects in the defect tracking system. Less time is spent discussing whether the behavior is a bug or a new feature, and more time is spent on developing quality. software that meets customer expectations. There is many opportunities to establish collaboration even before the coding begins.&#xA;Testers can help clients write acceptance tests in the language their subject area using tools such as Fit (Framework for Integration test). If these tests are given to the programmers before they start writing code, they will be able to apply the practice of acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Programmers write frameworks to run the tests, and then code to ensure they pass. these tests.</description>

      <title>Before starting the refactoring</title>

      <description>Sooner or later, every programmer has to perform refactoring of existing code. But before diving in, consider a few things that can save you and your colleagues a lot of time (and spare you from headaches):&#xA;It is best to start refactoring by assessing the state of the existing code in the project and the tests written for it. This way, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the code in its current state, to preserve its strong points and avoid the mistakes already made. Everyone thinks their system will be better than the current one&amp;hellip; until it turns out that the new code is no better, and maybe even worse, than the previous version, all because we did not learn from the mistakes made in the old system.</description>

      <title>The golden rule of API design</title>

      <description>Designing application programming interfaces (APIs) is difficult, especially in the general case. When developing an API that will have hundreds or thousands of users, you need to consider that over time it will most likely need to be changed, and these changes can disrupt the functioning of the client code. Moreover, you need to consider the potential impact on your API from its users. If the API class calls its own method, it should be remembered that the user is capable of creating a subclass of your class and overriding this method, which can lead to disaster. And you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to change this method because some of your users have given it a different meaning. You become dependent on your users when it comes to choosing the internal implementation.</description>
