      <description>Evening is drawing near. Even the air in the room seems to be pulsing at a working pace; the command is pleasant regarding the new features planned for the current iteration. But John is waiting for a date, so he&amp;rsquo;s a touch rushed. He still has time to rush off, rewrite his portion of the code, build it, and register it in the source code management system. After a few minutes, the app&amp;rsquo;s assembly is disrupted, and the &amp;ldquo;red light&amp;rdquo; is lit.John acted rashly, assuming that the team would stall because he didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for automated tests.&#xA;The working rhythm has failed; the circumstances have altered. Everyone is now aware that updating the code from the version control system will cause it to malfunction on their local machines.</description>
