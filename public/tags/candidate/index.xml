      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to interviews again, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some observations. This time we talk about live coding in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.&#xA;Live Coding There&amp;rsquo;s always a lot of noise around him. Some people like it (interviews), some people don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all (candidates), and someone goes to a psychologist after him for six months. This is not really to understand that the candidate is able to code; there are not enough extensive projects on Github, profile articles with code, reports after all. As I was told, this is done to ensure that everyone is treated equally in recruitment. Well, good luck hiring a leader or a gentleman in five rounds. At the second, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask himself, &amp;ldquo;Do I really need this?</description>
