During the application design process, the main focus of the architects is primarily on developers equipped with integrated environments and debuggers.If something goes wrong, skilled programmers switch to debugging mode and find the error.Such a picture is quite natural, as most architects spend the majority of their lives in the role of developers rather than system administrators.">

    <p>Support and maintenance of applications should never, under any circumstances, be sidelined.Since more than 80% of an application&rsquo;s life cycle is spent in the maintenance phase, you should pay close attention to support and maintenance issues already during the design stage.If you forget about this, soon you will look on in horror as your application transforms from the architect&rsquo;s dream into something repulsive, dying in convulsions and forever remaining in people&rsquo;s memories as your failure.</p>
<p>During the application design process, the main focus of the architects is primarily on developers equipped with integrated environments and debuggers.If something goes wrong, skilled programmers switch to debugging mode and find the error.Such a picture is quite natural, as most architects spend the majority of their lives in the role of developers rather than system administrators.Unfortunately, the developer and the support specialist possess different skills – similar to how the development/testing environment and the production environment serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Here are examples of problems that a system administrator faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The administrator cannot resend the request to reproduce the issue.In a work environment, you cannot perform a financial transaction in the &ldquo;live&rdquo; database just to see where the error occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the application is in a production environment, the demands to fix bugs come from users and management, rather than from the project manager and the testing team – and angry management is much more dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no debugger in the working environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the work environment, the deployment process is planned and coordinated in advance.No one will allow you to disable the application for a few minutes to test the fix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a development environment, log messages usually contain much more detailed information than in a production environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the symptoms of insufficient support planning look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most problems require the involvement of a developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between the development team and the support service is quite tense; developers believe that the support service is made up of nothing but idiots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The support service hates the new app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams of architects and developers spend a lot of time in the working environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application is often restarted to resolve issues that arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrators are always short on time for proper system configuration because they are constantly engaged in &ldquo;putting out fires.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for your application to successfully operate after it is released from the developers&rsquo; hands, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To understand that development and maintenance require different skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we involve the head of the technical support service in the project as early as possible?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the head of the technical support service one of the central figures of the project team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involve the head of the technical support service in planning application support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Design the product so that the training of support staff occurs at maximum speed. Traceability, auditing, and logs play an extremely important role in support.When the system administrators are satisfied, everyone else is also happy (especially your boss).</p>
