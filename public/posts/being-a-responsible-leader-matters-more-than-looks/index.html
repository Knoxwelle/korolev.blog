<p>An architect should play a worthy role in responsible leadership.</p>
<p>A software architect&rsquo;s work is typically focused on satisfying user needs, with input from experts in the field to help guide the way.A compromise between the time and workforce available to complete the project and the cost and complexity of execution results in a successful design.</p>
<p>The architect&rsquo;s time and money are firm resources, and he or she must manage them honestly and without any deceptive tactics to further personal agendas. It is rare for highly complicated systems built on contemporary infrastructure or technologies to be completed without incurring additional costs for the business. Similar to an investment broker, an architect is entrusted with his clients&rsquo; money, and it is expected that his work will yield a respectable return on investment.</p>
<p>Never forget that you are handling other people&rsquo;s money; handling responsibly is more vital than making a good impression.</p>
