    <p>In Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s novel &ldquo;Cryptonomicon,&rdquo; Randy Waterhouse presents his classification of the races he has encountered.Gnomes are hard workers, toiling over works of art in the darkness of their caves.They command immense forces capable of moving mountains and transforming landscapes, and they are renowned for their skill. Elves are distinguished by their sophistication and high culture; they spend their days creating new beautiful magical objects.They are so talented that they don&rsquo;t even realize how supernatural these objects appear to other races. Wizards are endowed with immense power, but unlike elves, they know a great deal about magic, understand its nature and possibilities, and apply it in the most effective and impressive ways. However, there is also a fourth type that Waterhouse mentions briefly, without pausing for a detailed description.These are kings – wise rulers who know how to govern all others.</p>
<p>The architect is somewhat related to the &ldquo;royal lineage.&ldquo;He should have a good understanding of all the other &ldquo;races&rdquo; and ensure that appropriate roles are designated for all of them in the architecture. Architecture designed with only one &ldquo;race&rdquo; in mind will attract representatives of that particular &ldquo;race&rdquo; to the project.And even if the team consists of the most skilled &ldquo;dwarves,&rdquo; or the most talented &ldquo;elves,&rdquo; or the most powerful &ldquo;wizards,&rdquo; a one-sided approach to problem-solving will seriously limit the team&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>A good king leads all the &ldquo;races&rdquo; of his subjects toward a great goal and helps them work side by side to achieve it.Without a great goal, the team will lack direction, and its work will ultimately turn into guerrilla raids.Without representatives of all &ldquo;races,&rdquo; the team will only be able to solve problems of one type and will come to a halt at the first obstacle that does not align with that solution.The architect indicates the goal, taking into account the characteristics of all &ldquo;races.&ldquo;Then architecture becomes a guide for finding tasks that team members from different &ldquo;races&rdquo; can engage in while getting to know each other better.When the project encounters difficulties, the team will already know how to approach overcoming them, because the architecture has allowed the team to become one cohesive unit.</p>
