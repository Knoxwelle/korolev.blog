    <p>A competent architect ought to lead by example. He should be able to take the position of any team member and handle any task, including creating modular tests, conducting performance tests, and setting up networking and the assembly process. In the absence of a thorough comprehension of all available technologies, an architect is really no different from a regular project manager.Although it is rather typical for team members to be more knowledgeable in their specialized professions, they are unlikely to be able to trust their architect unless he is conversant with the technology being employed.Since an architect serves as a liaison between the technical team and the company, as has already been mentioned, he must be well-versed in all technical facets in order to represent the team to the business management without continuously seeking assistance.For similar reasons, in order to properly guide the developers toward the objective of meeting the company&rsquo;s commercial goals, the architect must have a thorough understanding of the business aspects of the organization.</p>
<p>Similar to an aviation pilot, an architect employs decades of experience to monitor the situation and act quickly in case of an emergency, even if he may not appear to be working very hard.The architect is relieved of daily staff management and mundane tasks by the project manager (second pilot).In the end, the architect has to take accountability for the product&rsquo;s caliber and prompt delivery.Without personal authority, which is crucial to the accomplishment of any project, these problems are hard to overcome.</p>
<p>Seeing other people is the finest method to learn; this is how we learn when we are young.A competent architect should be able to recognize an issue, assemble a team, and convey the core of the issue without searching for the cause of it before suggesting a sophisticated workaround or solution.The architect retains all power while soliciting assistance from the team.Although developers should feel that they have contributed to the issue, the architect leads the conversation and chooses the best course of action.</p>
<p>Architects should work &ldquo;in the field&rdquo; with other team members from the very beginning of the project, rather than sitting in an ivory tower and offering guidance.The decisions about technology and strategic direction should not be made into new projects or independent research; instead, they should be handled pragmatically, with the help of colleagues who are also architects (since competent architects are acquainted).</p>
<p>Remember that an architect should be a practitioner, hence a good architect has to own at least one professional tool at the expert level, such as an integrated design environment (IDE).It makes sense that the database architect should be familiar with the toolset used to create entity-relation charts (ER-charts), the information architect with XML modeling tools, and the software architect with the IDE.The lead architect must, however, be proficient with all levels of tool application; he is not limited to any level, be it low or high. Examples of this include using Wireshark to monitor network traffic or XMLSpy to simulate sophisticated financial transactions.</p>
<p>Although it is normally simple to wow the technical staff and management, he is unlikely to get the team&rsquo;s respect if he cannot demonstrate his abilities in a real-world setting.The team will find it difficult to teach new members in such a scenario, and it is unlikely that they will be able to accomplish the work for which they were employed.</p>
