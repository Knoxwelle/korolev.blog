<title>Never put the demands of the client ahead of your resume. • Tiny Dev Blog</title>


<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"><meta name="twitter:title" content="Never put the demands of the client ahead of your resume.">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="We, technicians, choose to use certain technologies, methodologies and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the optimal solution, but only because in the depths of our heart we want to mention them in our summary. Such a choice very rarely leads to a positive result.
The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client.">

The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client. Remember that you as an architect are entrusted with the well-being of your organization; accordingly, you are expected to act honestly and competently in the interests of the customer, avoiding any conflicts of interest andining full loyalty to your organization. If the proposed project is not relevant or promising enough for your current career goals, find another project.<br>
What if it&rsquo;s not possible, and you&rsquo;re still forced to participate in such a project? It will be better for you and everyone else if you choose technology for the benefit of the customer rather than your resume. Sometimes it is difficult to resist the temptation to apply a new fashionable solution, even if it does not fit the current situation.<br>
With the right solution you get a satisfied team and satisfied client, and the overall stress of work on the project is noticeably decreases.Often this allows you to study a already familiar technology in depth or engage in the development of novelty in your spare time. Or maybe you even have free time to attend the painting courses you have always dreamed of .Your loved ones will appreciate it too – they will notice the difference in your condition when you come home after work.<br>
Always put a customer’s long-term needs above your own short-term requirements – and you will not be mistaken.</p>
