    <p>The ethical aspect of software becomes evident when it comes to civil rights, theft of personal data or malware.However, it is also manifested in less exotic circumstances in calves.Successful programs affect the lives of thousands, if not millions of people.Their impact can be both positive and negative.Programs can improve or deteriorate our lives, even to a slight extent.</p>
<p>Every time I make a decision about the behavior of a program, I actually decide what its users can and can&rsquo;t do. And the decision is much tougher than the law: there is no appeal court in which the choice of mandatory fields or strict sequence of transactions could be contested.</p>
<p>This problem can also be seen from the point of view of the scale effect.Remember stories about the latest Internet worms or blockbuster movies.You must have met the estimates of how many working hours were lost because of them on a country-wide scale.You can always find some analyst with estimates of unprecedented damage caused by something that can distract a person from the desktop.The morality of this story is not at all to denounce the mathematical ignorance of the press and the cheap pursuit of sensations.In fact, this is about the effect that small numbers can have on a large scale.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have to make a decision about some function. There are two implementation options: a simple one that requires one day&rsquo;s work, and a complex one that will take a week. In the simple version, you have to enter four new mandatory fields, and in the complex program, it is smart enough to process incomplete data.Which way should you choose?</p>
<p>Mandatory fields look rather harmless, but with them you impose your will on users, forcing them to collect additional information before they start work. And this often means that the data will have to be written on paper to gather it in one place and enter it into the system at once. All this leads to data loss and delays, and also irritates users.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take this analogy: let&rsquo;s say I need to attach a sign to the building. Can it be mounted at a height of 1.8 meters, making pedestrians dive under it or by it? Of course, it will be easier for me to do without stairs and building forests, with the sign not even completely blocking traffic. I save an hour on installation for the price of two seconds, which I take from every pedestrian passing by my store. Over time, the amount of these two seconds losses will be much more than the hour I save.</p>
<p>Successful programs affect the lives of millions of people, but every decision you make actually imposes your will on users. Always remember that your decisions will affect those people’s lives. Be prepared to take on an extra burden to remove some of the burden from your users.</p>
