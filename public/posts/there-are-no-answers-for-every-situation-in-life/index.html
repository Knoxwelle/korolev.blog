    <p>For a wide range of different problems, there isn&rsquo;t a single, comprehensive solution, so the architect must continuously refine and improve his &ldquo;context noe poche.&rdquo; Eberhardt Rechtin writes in &ldquo;Systems Architecting: Creating and Building Complex Systems&rdquo; (Prentice Hall, 1991):</p>
<p>&lt;&hellip;&gt; Rather than using the word &ldquo;sensual,&rdquo; it might be better to speak to it as &ldquo;context sensation&rdquo;—knowledge of what is pertinent in a certain context. By the time an architect-practitioner is called to address a system-level issue, which usually takes decades, they can have a strong contextual awareness thanks to education, experience, and case studies.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems I see with the software industry, in my opinion, is that projects are often given to people who don&rsquo;t have enough contextual knowledge.This could be due to the fact that the industry is only two generations old and is currently experiencing a time of rapid expansion; alternatively, it could be that the industry has reached a mature stage if this problem has been resolved.</p>
<p>I deal with this issue on a regular basis in my consulting practice, in all its manifestations. Here are a few examples of typical ones: Rejecting domain-driven design when it makes sense; being unduly excited about the creation of a software solution for a task that doesn&rsquo;t require any delay; and suggesting ridiculous or useless ideas when attempts to optimize the performance of the system are stalled.</p>
<p>Knowing when to use and when not to utilize program templates is essential to comprehending them.This also applies to theories on what the root causes of the problem are and how best to solve it. When designing the architecture of the system or analyzing the issue, an architect must develop his contextual sense, formulate architectural solutions, and identify and eliminate any flaws in those solutions because there is, by definition, no universal solution &ldquo;for all cases of life&rdquo; in either scenario.</p>
