The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm.

<p>The most powerful catalyst for your career will be grateful customers who are in a long queue to recommend you to others – because you have worked so well for them. The kindness of the customers will serve you better than any new-fashioned object of the new language and any newly invented paradigm. While it is very important (and even vital) for an architect to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, never try to expand your horizons at the expense of the client. As architects, you should always keep in mind that your company&rsquo;s success is entrusted to you. As such, you should behave with integrity and competence in the best interests of your clients, abstaining from conflicts of interest, and showing complete dedication to your company. If the proposed project is not relevant or promising enough for your current career goals, find another project.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s not possible, and you&rsquo;re still forced to participate in such a project? It will be better for you and everyone else if you choose technology for the benefit of the customer rather than your resume. Sometimes it is difficult to resist the temptation to apply a new fashionable solution, even if it does not fit the current situation.</p>
<p>With the right solution you get a satisfied team and satisfied client, and the overall stress of work on the project is noticeably decreases. Often this allows you to study a already familiar technology in depth or engage in the development of novelty in your spare time. Or maybe you even have free time to attend the painting courses you have always dreamed of. Your loved ones will appreciate it too – they will notice the difference in your condition when you come home after work.</p>
<p>Always put a customer’s long-term needs above your own short-term requirements – and you will not be mistaken.</p>
