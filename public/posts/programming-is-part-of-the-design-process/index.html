    <p>Kristen Nygaard, the father of the object-oriented mapping and programming language Simula, said that programming is learning.A realization that programming, or more precisely software development, is a process of study and creative search, rather than the process of production and design, is fundamental to improving the techniques of development.Ideas from traditional engineering disciplines in software development don&rsquo;t work.The problems that arise have been documented and analysed by leading thinkers in our field for more than 30 years.For example, in 1987, Frederick Brooks, Jr., in the &ldquo;Rapport of the Ratifying Group of the Ministry of Defence Scientific Council on Military Software&rdquo;, argued that the document-oriented approach of &ldquo;first specification, then development&rdquo; was at the heart of many software problems.</p>
<p>Where can the software industry draw practical ideas to improve its techniques?What about the industries of complex commodities of mass production: cars, medicines, semiconductors?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the automotive industry. Planning a new model begins with the choice of a concept or prototype.This is primarily an architectural positioning mechanism.The BMW X6 is an example of a new concept that combines the features of the SUV and the coupe, which BMW calls the sportsactivity coupe.Before you got the opportunity to buy a new X6, BMW spent thousands of hours and millions of dollars designing the machine and its manufacturing process.When BMW receives your order, one of the assembly lines switches and releases the X6 version made on your personal order.</p>
<p>What can we learn from the example of this scenario? The important thing here is that the production of a new machine consists of two processes. The first is the creative design process, which involves the installation of the necessary assembly lines.The second is the process of manufacturing machines according to customer specifications. Similar processes are present in many respects in the software development industry.The question is what meaning we put in terms.</p>
<p>In his article &ldquo;How to design software?&ldquo;1Jack Reeves argues that the only software development artifact that really describes design (in the sense that it is understood and used in classical engineering disciplines) is the source code.Software production is automated and supported by compilation, assembly and testing scenarios.</p>
<p>By agreeing that source code creation is part of design rather than production, we get the opportunity to apply useful management techniques that have been tested by time.These are methods of managing creative and unpredictable work, such as designing a new machine, a new drug, or a new computer game.We are talking about methods of agile management and lean production (e.g. SCRUM).These methods are aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of investments from the point of view of value for the consumer.</p>
<p>To benefit from these techniques in software development, it is important to remember that programming is part of the design process, not production.</p>
