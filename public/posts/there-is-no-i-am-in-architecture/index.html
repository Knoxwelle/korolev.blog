    <p>Of course, there is an &ldquo;I&rdquo; in architecture. However, this is not the primary &ldquo;I&rdquo; that draws attention and controls conversations.
It only takes a series of letters.
For us software architects, what does that mean? Sometimes, our greatest threat comes from our own ego. Who hasn&rsquo;t seen architects who: • believe they know the specifications better than the clients; • see developers as resources employed to carry out their concepts; or • dismiss any skepticism regarding their own or other architects&rsquo; ideas?
Any seasoned architect has probably made at least one of these errors at some point.I&rsquo;ve given in to all of them and have gained harsh insight from my mistakes.</p>
<p>Why is this taking place?
• Our success has already been attained. Experience and success help us become more confident and capable architects. Greater projects follow success. But there&rsquo;s a very fine line between self-reliance and self-confidence. The project eventually becomes beyond our capabilities. When we step beyond that boundary but refuse to acknowledge it, that&rsquo;s when self-confidence starts.
• We are respected by others. Resolving intricate design problems establishes a trustworthiness credit, or &ldquo;insurance net.&rdquo; We can ignore crucial design difficulties due to our own intolerance, self-confidence, or desire to depend only on personal experience.
• Humans are all that we are. Every building has a little bit of the architect himself.When someone criticizes your work, it seems like an attack on you. It is easy to give in to temptation and adopt a defensive stance; it is more challenging to learn how to resist doing so. It is easy to take pride in your achievements; it is more challenging to discover, on your own, the boundaries of your potential.</p>
<p>How can we keep this from happening?
Necessities are honest. Any architecture that satisfies the requirements, if they are accurate and comprehensive, would be good.Collaborate carefully with the client to ensure that you both comprehend the significance of each business necessity. The requirements, not you, are what shape architecture.All you need to do is make every effort to see to it that they are carried out.
Concentrate on your group. Team members serve as more than simply a resource; they are also your &ldquo;insurance net&rdquo; and design helpers.
Those who have undervalued typically receive subpar sub-insurance. It is collaboration that shapes architecture, not you alone. The heavy labor is done together, but you provide the instructions.Both of you and them depend on each other for support.
Verify your work. A model is merely your interpretation of how architecture ought to function; it is not an architecture. Together with the team, develop tests that demonstrate how each requirement is supported by the project architecture.
Pay attention to yourself. The majority of us must fight the innate inclination to prioritize our own self-interest, protect our work, and think we are the smartest person in the room. These traits show up when things get tough. Every day, set aside some time to consider your interactions with other people. Have you given each other&rsquo;s opinions the respect and consideration they deserve? Did you receive any unfavorable feedback regarding the insightful proposals? Do you truly grasp why someone found your method objectionable?
Success is not certain if the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is left out of the architecture. All it does is remove the typical cause of mistakes that are entirely your responsibility.</p>
