    <p>The traditional technical processes that come to mind when creating a software architecture are breaking the system down into its component parts, defining interfaces, assigning tasks, using templates, and performance tuning. The architect also needs to consider a variety of additional factors, such as output management, deployment settings, simplicity of usage, safety, and ease of maintenance.All of these procedural and technical details, meanwhile, have to be pertinent to the needs of the stakeholders.One of the best ways to make sure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are comprehensive is to consider these interests during the requirements analysis process.</p>
<p>Each project participant has interests that impact the corporation as a whole as well as the software development process the company uses. The architect&rsquo;s final set of priorities is derived from a consideration of these interests. One may argue that the process of creating architecture involves striking a balance between short- and long-term perspective priorities within the given framework.</p>
<p>Consider the engineering division of a company that offers software development services. This firm most likely prioritizes paying its bills on time, making money, maintaining a positive reputation with clients, cutting expenses, and developing important technical assets. These business priorities become the department&rsquo;s top priorities, which include making sure the product is developed with functionality, accuracy, and &ldquo;quality attributes,&rdquo; as well as ensuring the development team&rsquo;s productivity, the design process&rsquo; sustainability, its auditability, and the software products&rsquo; adaptability and durability.</p>
<p>An architect&rsquo;s job description goes beyond just producing high-caliber software for users; it also includes considering the interests of other stakeholders, such as the company&rsquo;s management (cost reduction), the product&rsquo;s staff (ease of administration), potential programmers (easy study and support), and the professional community of architects.</p>
<p>For a little period, the architect can purposefully tip the scales in favor of one of the priorities, but in the long run, distortions should be avoided if you want the task done exceptionally effectively.Simultaneously, the balances should be in line with the current context, including elements like the software product&rsquo;s anticipated longevity, its importance to the organization, and its technical and financial culture.</p>
<p>To put it briefly, designing a software product architecture involves more than just the technical parts; it also requires striking the correct balance between the needs of all stakeholders&rsquo; business requirements and the technological requirements.</p>
