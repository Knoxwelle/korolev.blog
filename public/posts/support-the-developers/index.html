    <p>It&rsquo;s usually easier said than done; when it comes to talking, architects certainly know how to do it.In order for your words not to turn into empty air (the main method of building castles in the air), you will need a good team of developers.As a rule, the role of an architect is to impose constraints, but you also have the opportunity to lift those constraints.Do everything in your power to give developers the freedom they need.</p>
<p>Make sure that developers have all the necessary tools. The toolkit should not be imposed from above – it should be thoughtfully selected so that developers always have everything they need at hand. Routine tasks should be automated whenever possible. Additionally, do not hesitate to invest in providing developers with modern computers, sufficiently wide communication channels, and access to the programs, data, and information necessary to perform their work.</p>
<p>Ensure that the developers possess the necessary skills. If the developers need training, make sure they can undergo it.Buy books and encourage active discussions about technology.The working life of a developer should be occupied with practical activities, but this should not interfere with active skill enhancement.If you have sufficient resources, send your team to technical presentations and conferences.If not, connect the team to the technical mailing lists and keep an eye on free events in your city. If possible, please also participate in the selection process of developers.Look for those who are eager to learn, who have a &ldquo;spark&rdquo; of technical talent (but make sure they are capable of working in a team…).It&rsquo;s hard to achieve something outstanding from a group of faceless workers.</p>
<p>Allow developers to make independent decisions as long as those decisions do not contradict the overall goal of the system project.But where restrictions are truly important, implement them – not only out of concern for quality but also for additional support for developers.Create standards not only to ensure consistency in actions but also to reduce the number of bothersome minor decisions that are unrelated to the main task at hand for developers.Clearly define where the source files should be located, what names they should be assigned, when to create new versions, and so on.This will save developers time.</p>
<p>Finally, shield developers from the non-essential aspects of their work. Excessive paperwork and other office distractions generate unproductive costs and reduce efficiency. You may not be a manager, but you can influence the processes related to development. Whatever processes are used in your case, make sure they eliminate obstacles rather than create them.</p>
