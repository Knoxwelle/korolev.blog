    <p>Recently, there has been a sad trend in the area of software development: the desire to give the software architecture a professional status on the same level as the classical school of architecture.It appears to be due to the desire of architects to affirm their successes and achievements in the eyes of the wider public, rather than the circle of colleagues and direct employers.But architecture gained professional status only at the end of the 19th century – a millennium after its birth. Some software architects are too hasty in their quest for recognition.</p>
<p>Software architecture is an art, and practice and discipline are undoubtedly essential to success. Yet software development is at a relatively early stage. We do not yet have sufficient information on this industry to reasonably give it professional status. Despite the youth of the software development industry, its products are highly valued, and the services of qualified professionals in this field (as well as those who aspire to appear) are paid at the same level as in the leading professional fields, including medicine, accounting and law.</p>
<p>Apprentices in the field of software development are well paid for their creative, research-related work.The fruits of our work have been used to many significant results, some of which have benefited all of humanity. The obstacles to recognition are our real merits and capabilities; in areas that have reached professional maturity, there are training programmes and internships that are significantly superior to our industry counterparts.Think about it and see how much reason we have to be satisfied with the current state of affairs and how daring it would be to insist that the software architect should stand on the same level as the lawyer, the doctor, and the dentist.</p>
<p>The post of &ldquo;software architect&rdquo; is written with the strict letter &ldquo;a&rdquo;; recognize this fact and accept it.</p>
