<p>Conversely, problems that we believe must be resolved in order to lessen the inherent complexity are the source of unintended complexity. A modest example of complexity is the flight management system, which is now out of date and yet in use.The system was created to handle the difficult task of coordinating the flight of thousands of aircraft; however, this solution has drawbacks of its own. Upgrading today&rsquo;s flight control systems is challenging, if not impossible, due to their complexity. With the advancement of almost thirty years of technology, flight management is used globally.</p>
<p>Many business &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; and infrastructures (frameworks) exhibit &ldquo;secondary complexity syndrome.&rdquo; Infrastructures built to address particular, constrained issues yield real benefits; excessively complex infrastructures, on the other hand, exacerbate the situation.</p>
<p>Just as fires draw moths, complex solutions also tend to draw developers—and frequently with the same outcome. It&rsquo;s fascinating to solve complicated problems because programming is essentially the solving of puzzles. Who hasn&rsquo;t been charmed by the accomplishment of an extraordinarily challenging task? However, concentrating on work with intrinsic complexity makes it very difficult to avoid secondary complexity in large-scale initiatives.</p>
<p>Working-code infrastructures are preferable to ivory towers. Compare the amount of code that just facilitates user interaction with the application to that which is meant to solve the current goal. The solutions that the developers offer should be used with caution; while they may seem good at first, they frequently have additional complexity. Verify that the answer complies with the assignment.</p>
<p>The architect&rsquo;s job is to address problems that fall within the realm of inherent complexity, avoiding the introduction of extraneous complications.</p>
