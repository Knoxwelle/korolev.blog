    <p>High performance, high availability, high security, and high abstraction cannot all be achieved at the same time in an architecture. Software architects just need to be aware of, comprehend, and share one true story with their clients and peers. I&rsquo;m referring to Vaza&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>There was a conflict between Sweden and Poland in 1620. The Swedish King ordered the building of a gallion known as the Vase in an attempt to swiftly conclude this costly conflict. The ship was unique. It had different specifications than any other ship of the era. In addition to carrying 64 weapons on two battery decks and transporting 300 men at a time safely to Poland by sea, it had to be longer than sixty meters. There was not enough money, and there was running out of time (sounds familiar?). Such ships have never been designed by the shipyard before. His specialty was single-decker, smaller boats. Still, he went ahead and designed and built the Vaza, using his prior knowledge and skills. Consequently, a ship that satisfied these requirements was constructed. Today is the day when the water falls. The ship saluted with all of her cannons as it entered the harbor with pride. Then he went under.</p>
<p>Anyone who had seen the deck of a large 17th-century battleship understood that the Vaza problem was evident: these ships&rsquo; decks were dangerously crowded, especially during battle. Ships designed for both transport and fighting were a costly miscalculation. In an attempt to grant the king&rsquo;s every whim, the shipbuilder constructed a wobbly and unbalanced vessel.</p>
<p>When creating the architecture of a software product, a software architect might learn a lot from this narrative and consider this depressing experience.When needs are attempted to be met all at once (like with the Vaza), an unstable architecture is produced that is unable to precisely complete any of the jobs. Forcing service-oriented architecture (SOA) to operate as a point-to-point solution simultaneously is a good illustration of this. This typically requires us to avoid the many layers of abstraction produced by the SOA methodology, and the end product is an architecture that looks like spaghetti at an Italian restaurant. When creating architecture, an architect can identify the sacrifices that must be made using a variety of tools. The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) and the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM) are two well-liked techniques of this type. You may get more details on ATAM and CBAM on the website of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).</p>
