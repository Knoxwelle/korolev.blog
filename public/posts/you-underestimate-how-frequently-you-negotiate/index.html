    <p>We&rsquo;ve all been &ldquo;buried&rdquo; for savings through ingenious technological &ldquo;budget&rdquo; changes.The conversation goes like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is X really necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>X can replace nearly anything that is required for the system, such as additional servers, software licenses, external backups, and power supplies. The question is always asked in a casual tone, as if you are spending your entire allowance on gum and comic books, and older people ought to think about buying new shells to save their money for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the right answer to this question. absolutely necessary.&quot;   However, almost no one answers, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>After all, we have technical education, and every technical occupation requires the ability to compromise.It is evident that nobody will need unconventional power sources if several white wheels are installed in the data center and interns are stationed there. We suggest something more accurate in response than a resounding &ldquo;Yes, absolutely necessary&rdquo;: &ldquo;You can actually get by without a second server if you&rsquo;re willing to live with the gaps caused by prevention and by every memory failure.&rdquo; But if we get a memory with automatic regularity control, this problem can be avoided. As a result, the server needs to reload at night because the operating system only faults once every 3.9 days on average. Even yet, when the trainees get tired of rotating the wheels, they might still rely on it.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t say it, even though everything above might be true. The moment you say &ldquo;really,&rdquo; the sponsor quits up on you.</p>
<p>The problem is that, from a technical point of view, your sponsor is clearly aware that he is negotiating. He&rsquo;s attempting to use a tactical &ldquo;go out/do not go out&rdquo; move as you work together to find a solution. Moreover, in a negotiation, you should never yield to the first demand made. The appropriate answer to the question &ldquo;Do we really need X?&rdquo; is as follows:.</p>
<p>Without a second server, the entire system will &ldquo;fall&rdquo; about three times a day, especially during high load periods during board demos. We actually need four servers in order to ensure that one independent pair continues to operate at 100% even in the event that the other pair unexpectedly fails.</p>
<p>Of course, you are well aware that the third and fourth servers are not really necessary. This is a calculated move meant to force your sponsor to steer the topic in a different direction. You up the ante and show that the system is still in use, albeit in a crude and risky version. Furthermore, in the unlikely event that you come across additional servers, you can always use one for testing (making sure the testing environment is the same as the operational one) and the other as a superb assembly machine.</p>
