<meta name="twitter:description" content="Customers and end-users often demand what they think is an effective solution to a problem. A classic example of this is given by Harry Hillaker, the leading designer of the F-16 Falcon. His group had set the goal of designing an aircraft developing M2–2.5 speeds, which was (and probably remains) a very non-trivial task, especially if the accompanying objective was to create a “cheap” light aircraft. Consider that the force required to overcome the air resistance increases by four times the speed of flight, and imagine how this circumstance affects the weight of the aircraft.
When the design team asked the Air Force customers why they needed the M2–2.5 speed, they replied, &ldquo;That the aircraft could get out of battle if necessary.&rdquo; When the real need became apparent, the designers were able to solve the main problem and present a workable solution: a mobile aircraft with high traction, providing good acceleration and maneuverability instead of high maximum speed.">

    <p>Customers and end-users often demand what they think is an effective solution to a problem. A classic example of this is given by Harry Hillaker, the leading designer of the F-16 Falcon. His group had set the goal of designing an aircraft developing M2–2.5 speeds, which was (and probably remains) a very non-trivial task, especially if the accompanying objective was to create a “cheap” light aircraft. Consider that the force required to overcome the air resistance increases by four times the speed of flight, and imagine how this circumstance affects the weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>When the design team asked the Air Force customers why they needed the M2–2.5 speed, they replied, &ldquo;That the aircraft could get out of battle if necessary.&rdquo; When the real need became apparent, the designers were able to solve the main problem and present a workable solution: a mobile aircraft with high traction, providing good acceleration and maneuverability instead of high maximum speed.</p>
<p>The lesson is equally true in software development. Having learned from the customer the true meaning of the requested possibility or requirement, the architect will be able to penetrate the essence of the problem and, if lucky, offer a solution that is more quality and cost-effective compared to the one on which the client insists. Increased attention to the essence of requirements also simplifies the priority setting: the most important requirements for the customer become decisive.</p>
<p>How should we act? In the manifesto of agile development, there is a principle that fits very well in many cases: &ldquo;Cooperation is more important than contract.&rdquo; From a practical point of view, this involves holding workshops and meetings where architects analyze the customer’s needs, helping them answer the question “Why?” Bear in mind that finding an answer to this question can be a very difficult task because the process of demand analysis often involves implicit assumptions and implied knowledge. Discussions about technical solutions should be avoided at such meetings because they transfer discussion from the client&rsquo;s subject area to the area of programming.</p>
