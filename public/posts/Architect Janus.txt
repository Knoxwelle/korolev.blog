In ancient Rome, Janus was considered the god of beginnings and endings, doors and passages.He was usually depicted with two heads facing in different directions; this symbol is often found on coins and in films.Janus symbolizes transitions and changes in life – birth, marriage, reaching maturity – from the past to the future, from youth to old age.

Janus's ability to look both forward and backward, to see the past and the future, is an exceptionally valuable skill for both a software architect and a building architect.The architect strives to unite reality with their vision of it, past achievements with future plans, and management expectations with development constraints.Building such bridges is a crucial part of an architect's work.Often, an architect feels that in their pursuit to bring a project to completion, they must overcome chasms created by forces pulling in opposite directions.This could include, for example, ease of use and safety, or alignment with current business processes and a focus on the vision outlined by management. A good architect must have "two heads," capable of holding two different ideas or concepts, two different goals or perspectives, so that they can create a product that satisfies all stakeholders in the project.

Note: Janus has two heads, not just two faces.In other words, he has an extra pair of ears and eyes, which enhances his awareness and sensitivity. A good IT architect should be an excellent listener and analyst. Understanding the reasons behind investments is vital for determining the goals and visions of management regarding the future of the organization. The ability to assess the technical skills of your staff in the area of design and the technologies used in the project will help form suitable pairs for training and work.Knowledge of which open-source solutions can be used in conjunction with various commercial off-the-shelf software will significantly reduce the budget and timeline for project implementation.A good architect must understand these and many other components of the development process and be able to put them to work for themselves to ensure the overall success of the project.

Some bosses expect their architects to possess almost divine abilities, but that's not what I meant when comparing an architect to a deity.A good architect is open to new ideas, tools, and design methods that contribute to the progress of the project, the development of the team, or professional improvement; he does not wish to spend most of his time in meetings with management or writing code himself; he should recognize valuable ideas and create an atmosphere that fosters their maturation.Success in design can only be achieved by a truly open mind – a mind capable of finding the balance point among many opposing forces during the course of a project.Every architect strives to complete their project and ensure the success of their team.The best architects create systems that stand the test of time, as they are capable of maintaining functionality and evolving with the growth of the organization and changes in technology.Such architects listen to the opinions of others, analyze and refine their processes, methods, and approaches to design; they make special efforts to ensure that their products withstand inevitable changes and transitions.

What kind of mindset should we, as architects, strive for? It's easier said than done. Like Janus, the architect must become the guardian of doors and passages, bridging the gap between the old and the new; they must combine a creative approach with a reliable technical foundation, so that while meeting today's demands, they are prepared for tomorrow's changes.
