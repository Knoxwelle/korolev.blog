    <p>Almost all architects start their careers as developers.The architect has more responsibilities, but at the same time he has more influence in the design of the system.Per in your new role as an architect, it will be difficult for you to get rid of some of the developer habits.Worse still, you may feel like you need to constantly monitor the developers and their activities to implement your design.However, for your success (and your team&rsquo;s success) it is very important to give all your colleagues sufficient independence to demonstrate their skills and creativity.</p>
<p>A developer rarely has time to sit down and think about how coherent the system as a whole is.At the same time, all the attention of the architect should be focused on this.While developers focus on creating classes, methods, tests, interfaces, and databases, you watch how these components work together.Look for the narrow spots and try to eliminate them. Do your people have trouble writing tests? Improve interfaces and limit dependencies.It is unclear where abstraction is really necessary, and where can we do without it?Get a better understanding of the subject area.Don&rsquo;t you know how to create system components?Create a project plan.Do developers repeat the same errors when using the API you designed?Make the design easier to understand.Do the developers misunderstand your design?Talk to them and explain everything in detail.Do you misunderstand where scaling is appropriate and where not?Work with customers and understand their business model.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a good architect, you simply don&rsquo;t have time to interfere with developers.Of course, you will have to watch carefully enough to ensure that the implementation of your design corresponds to the intended. However, it is not necessary to stand behind the back of other people to do so.You can offer your solution when you see that the developers have encountered difficulties, but it is even better to create such an environment that they themselves come and turn to you for advice.A good architect skillfullyins balance, ensuring the success of architecture and leaving room for colleagues to realize their creative and intellectual potential.</p>
