Many architects put performance at the bottom of their lists – because computers process data unparalleledly faster than their users, and the architect thinks the speed of the system will be acceptable. And if modern systems are not fast enough, Moore&rsquo;s law will take care of everything.However, the speed of the equipment is only one aspect of the system.
Performance is sometimes viewed simply as the time it takes a system to respond to user input. But system architects need to take into account various aspects of performance, including the productivity of design analysts and programmers, the performance of user-to-system communication, and the speed of non-interactive components.">

<p>Many architects put performance at the bottom of their lists – because computers process data unparalleledly faster than their users, and the architect thinks the speed of the system will be acceptable. And if modern systems are not fast enough, Moore&rsquo;s law will take care of everything.However, the speed of the equipment is only one aspect of the system.</p>
<p>Performance is sometimes viewed simply as the time it takes a system to respond to user input. But system architects need to take into account various aspects of performance, including the productivity of design analysts and programmers, the performance of user-to-system communication, and the speed of non-interactive components.</p>
<p>The productivity of the people who build the system is often called productiveness.This indicator is very important because it directly affects the cost and timetable of the project.A team that submits projects with long delays and excessive expenditure is doomed to unpleasant conversations with the management.Choosing the right tools and ready-made components can dramatically affect how quickly the system will be built and start to make a profit.</p>
<p>The performance of user interaction plays a decisive role in how users adopt the system.Many system architecture factors contribute to this aspect of performance.The most obvious example is response time, but it is far from the only indicator.Equally important are the intuitive understanding of the interface and the number of operations that the user has to perform to its goal; both directly affect performance.</p>
<p>A good system specification determines not so much the response time in itself as the time of the task.It is defined as the amount of time required to solve a task from a specific subject area, including all user interactions with the system.In addition to response time, this feature includes the operator&rsquo;s time of reflection and time of input by the operator - values that are outside the scope of system control.However, the inclusion of these metrics contributes to the quality design of the user interface. By focusing on the way the information is presented and the number of operations required to solve the task, you will ultimately improve the human operator&rsquo;s productivity.</p>
<p>The performance of non-interactive components is equally important for the success of the system.For example, if it takes more than 24 hours to perform the nightly package tasks, the system becomes non-functional.The performance of emergency recovery components is also a critical factor.How long will it take to restore the system to normal operation if one of the parts of the system has completely failed?</p>
<p>When analyzing the implementation and operating mode of the consolidated system, architects and designers should always pay the most attention to performance.</p>
