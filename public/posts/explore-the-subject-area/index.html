The role of the software architect is to understand the challenge facing the business, business objectives and business requirements and transform them into a technical architectural solution that meets them.Knowledge of the subject area helps the architect decide which patterns to apply, how to plan future expansions and how to take account of industry trends to better prepare for change.For example, service-oriented architecture is suitable for some areas (for example, insurance business) and workflow-based architecture for others (for financial markets, for example).">

    <p>An effective software architect is skilled not only in technology, but also in the subject area of the problem solved. Without this knowledge, it is difficult to understand the business aspect of the task, purpose and requirements of the company, and thus it is hard to design an effective architecture that meets the needs of the business.</p>
<p>The role of the software architect is to understand the challenge facing the business, business objectives and business requirements and transform them into a technical architectural solution that meets them.Knowledge of the subject area helps the architect decide which patterns to apply, how to plan future expansions and how to take account of industry trends to better prepare for change.For example, service-oriented architecture is suitable for some areas (for example, insurance business) and workflow-based architecture for others (for financial markets, for example).Knowledge of the subject area helps to decide which architectural patterns best meet the specific needs of the organization.</p>
<p>Knowledge of industry trends in a particular area also helps the architect to design an effective architecture.For example, in the insurance business, the trend to car insurance “on demand” is gaining momentum, when the customer pays insurance only for the time of actual driving.This type of insurance is very convenient if you leave your car at the airport on Monday morning, depart to work, return on Friday and drive home.Knowing these trends allows you to plan their support in the architecture, even if the company you work for has not already planned them in its business model.</p>
<p>Understanding business goals also helps to design efficient arch texture.For example, does the organization you work for aim to expand through large-scale mergers and acquisitions? The answer to this question may affect the type of arch texture to be designed.If the answer is positive, the architecture may need to contain many levels of abstraction to facilitate the merger of business logic components.If the business strategy envisages building a company’s online presence in order to expand its market share, high availability will probably be a very important attribute.The architect is obliged to understand the goals of the company for which he works and to constantly check whether the architecture supports those goals.</p>
<p>Of all the architects I know, the most successful are those who combine broad practical knowledge in the technical field with a good knowledge of a specific subject area. They can communicate with the management and customers in a language they understand well in the subject area.This, in turn, gives the customer a sense of confidence that the architect knows what he is doing.Ownership of the subject area allows the architect to better understand the tasks, problems, goals, data and processes – all those factors that play a key role in designing an effective enterprise-level architecture.</p>
