    <p>I am not at all interested in your program.</p>
<p>I have plenty of my own problems and a long list of tasks. I only visited your site because of unverified rumors that your program would solve all my problems. Please forgive my skepticism.</p>
<p>If eye-tracking studies are correct, I&rsquo;ve already read the headline and am scrolling through the page looking for the blue underlined link Download Now. By the way, if I accessed this page from a browser running on Linux and my IP is from Canada, it can be assumed that I need the Linux version from a North American mirror, so please don&rsquo;t ask about that. I understand that the file download dialog will open immediately, so I&rsquo;ll send this thing to my downloads folder and continue reading.</p>
<p>When performing any action, a person analyzes the cost-benefit ratio. If your program drops below an acceptable level of quality for even a second, I will immediately discard it and find something else. Immediate reward is where the power lies.</p>
<p>The first barrier is the mindset. Think it&rsquo;s not a big deal? So take a look in your downloads folder. There are plenty of .tar and .zip files, right? Which part of them did you unpack? How many have you installed? For example, only a third of them serve any purpose other than being ballast for the hard drive.</p>
<p>Even if I want to receive home service, I do not wish for you to enter my house without an invitation. Before entering the install command, I would like to know exactly where you plan to place your data. This is my computer, and I want to keep it organized as much as possible. I also want to be able to uninstall your program the very second I become disappointed with it. Suspecting that this is impossible, I simply won&rsquo;t install it. My car runs smoothly, and I want it to stay that way.</p>
<p>If your program has a graphical interface, I would like to perform some simple task and see the result. The &ldquo;wizards&rdquo; won&rsquo;t help here because they do things I don&rsquo;t understand. It is highly likely that I will want to read or write a file. I don&rsquo;t want to create a project, import directories, or give you my email address. If everything works, let&rsquo;s move on to the tutorial.</p>
<p>If your software is a library, I continue to read your webpage in search of a brief beginner&rsquo;s guide. I need something like &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; in five straightforward lines of code, and for the result to be exactly as described on your website. No huge XML files or templates to fill out – just a single source code file. Don&rsquo;t forget, I also uploaded your competitor&rsquo;s product. Yeah, the very one who keeps going on all the forums about how much better his product is than yours. If everything works, let&rsquo;s move on to the textbook.</p>
<p>You do have the textbook, right? In a language I understand?</p>
<p>And if the tutorial mentions my problem, I feel encouraged. Now, when I read about what I will be able to do, it becomes interesting and even exciting. I lean back in my chair and sip tea – did I mention that I live in Canada? Now I will play with your examples and try to learn how to use your creation. If it solves my problems, I will send you a thank-you letter. I will also send bug reports when the app crashes and suggestions for new features. I will even tell my colleagues that your program is better than others, even though I haven&rsquo;t tried your competitors&rsquo; programs. And all because you paid such attention to my first tentative steps.</p>
<p>And how could I ever doubt you?</p>
