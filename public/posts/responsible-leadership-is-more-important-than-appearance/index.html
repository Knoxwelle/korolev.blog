    <p>When the architect attracted to the project, he has a clear desire to &ldquo;show himself&rdquo;.The appointment of a software architect usually indicates the company&rsquo;s confidence in the technical competence of the specialist; of course, the architect wants to show as soon as possible that he deserves that confidence.Unfortunately, some of us erroneously believe that it is necessary to “imagine yourself in all its glory” – to surprise, if not obscure the group with its technical genius.</p>
<p>The ability to make an impression on the audience plays an important role in marketing, but negatively affects the management of the program project. The architect should earn respect of his team through a responsible approach to the leadership and a good understanding of the technical and substantive areas of the problem solved.</p>
<p>Responsible leadership is a worthy role for the architect. The architect should act in the interests of the customer, and not insult the caprices of his ego.</p>
<p>The activity of a software architect is aimed at meeting the needs of users most often on the basis of guidance from those who know the subject area better than him.Successful design leads to a compromise between the cost/complexity of implementation and the time/workforce available to execute the project.</p>
<p>Time and expenditure are resources belonging to the company; the architect must manage them in good faith, without hidden attempts to realize his own goals. Excessively complex systems based on modern infrastructures or technologies are rarely done without additional costs on the part of the company. The architect, like an investment broker, is entrusted with the money of clients – and it is assumed that his work will provide an acceptable return on investment.</p>
<p>Managing with all possible responsibility is more important than making an impression; never forget that you are managing other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
