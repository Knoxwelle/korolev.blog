    <p>Somewhere right now, a different wage calculation project is failing miserably&hellip; and most likely not by yourself.</p>
<p>What caused that to occur? because the developers opted for Ruby over Smalltalk or Java or Python? since you choose to utilize Postgres over Oracle? or because you preferred the Windows platform even if you should have chosen Linux? As you are aware, technology is frequently held responsible for project failures.</p>
<p>People normally establish projects, and it is up to these individuals to decide whether the project as a whole succeeds or fails. And once that is the case, we ought to consider our options for assisting them in being successful.</p>
<p>Per, you believe that there is a team member that is underperforming and impeding the project&rsquo;s progress. The most significant technological advancement in human history is the very old and tried-and-true technology that is employed to handle these kinds of issues. You require communication.<br>
However, having communication techniques alone is insufficient as a technology. Being able to give others credit and trust, together with having respect for them, are critical abilities that transform an intelligent leader into an effective one.<br>
Of course, the subject is not closed, but following a few easy guidelines will greatly improve the efficacy of your correspondence with subordinates:</p>
<ul>
<li>View problem-solving discussions as productive conversations as opposed to confrontational scenarios.</li>
<li>Begin with favorable presumptions about others and see conversation as an opportunity to ask questions that pique your interest. By doing this, you can obtain more insightful information and prevent defensiveness from your interlocutors.</li>
<li>Only initiate the conversation while in a state that is conducive to communicating.</li>
<li>Your interlocutor is likely to view your nonverbal cues as an assault if you are generally unhappy, furious, agitated, and unbalanced.</li>
<li>Take advantage of circumstances like an opportunity for mutual gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask the developer if he can assist you participate in other people&rsquo;s discussions instead of telling him to keep quiet during meetings because he doesn&rsquo;t allow anyone to speak. Remind him that introverts require more time to engage in conversation, and that it would be very beneficial if he took a five-second pause before speaking.<br>
You will increase your efficiency and learn something new every time if you have a common goal in mind, control your emotions, and see the &ldquo;problems&rdquo; that your interlocutors present as opportunities to learn.</p>
