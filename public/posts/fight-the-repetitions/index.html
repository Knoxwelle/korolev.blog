    <p>Do your developers have to perform monotonous tasks that require almost no thought? Are there almost identical fragments in the code?Do you notice code that has been written using the &ldquo;copy-paste-modify&rdquo; method?If the answers are positive, then your team is working slower than it could be, and, strangely enough, the reason for that might be you.</p>
<p>Before we delve into explanations, let&rsquo;s agree on two truths regarding software development:</p>
<p>-Duplication is evil.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repetitive work slows down development.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an architect, you set the tone.You have the best understanding of the system as a whole, and most likely, it was you who set the direction of the work by creating a complete vertical cross-section of the system – an example that has been repeatedly copied by now. Every copy operation (whether the developer is copying a few lines of code, an XML file, or a class) indicates that there is something in the system that can be simplified or eliminated.Most often, it is not the logic of the subject area that is copied, but the infrastructure code that ensures its operation.For this reason, it is very important that you have a clear understanding of the possible effect of your examples. Any code snippets, any configuration examples in your examples will serve as the foundation for dozens, hundreds, and thousands of other parts of the system.Therefore, you must ensure that your code is clear, effectively conveys your intentions, and contains nothing but the most essential – the logic of the subject area. As an architect, you must be extremely sensitive to any repetitions, because everything you write will be repeated.</p>
<p>Such a thing doesn&rsquo;t happen in your system, right?And now take a look at this configuration file: what will need to be changed if it is applied to another part of the system, and what will remain the same?Or take a typical business logic level method: is there not a pattern in it that also appears in other methods with operations such as transaction processing, logging, authentication, or auditing?What about the level of access to the data?How often do identical fragments occur, differing only in the names of entities and fields?Look at things more broadly.Do you ever come across two or three lines of code that always go together and are perceived as a single entity, even though they work with different objects?All of these are examples of repetition.Over time, developers learn to filter out and ignore repetitions when reading code, focusing only on the interesting differences.But even with such a skill, reading code is slowed down. Such code is suitable for execution by a computer, but not for reading by developers.</p>
<p>Your direct duty is to eliminate repetitions.You may need to master a new infrastructure for this, create more advanced abstractions, consult specialists to develop aspect-oriented infrastructure, or write a few small code generators.And yet, repetitions will not disappear anywhere until someone takes special care of it.</p>
<p>And that someone is you.</p>
