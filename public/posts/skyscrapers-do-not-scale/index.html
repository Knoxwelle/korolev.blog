    <p>Software development is often compared to building skyscrapers, dams and roads.In some important aspects, this comparison is appropriate.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of construction is not the design of a building that will stand in place after completion, but the elaboration of the construction process.This process will begin with an empty site and end with a ready-made building. During this time, each worker should be able to apply his/her professional skills and the partially erected structure should remain stable. We can draw a useful lesson from this analogy as regards the deployment of large integrated systems.(And the “integrated” category includes virtually all corporate and web applications!)The traditional &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; deployment looks like you bring a bunch of beams and beams into the desert, throw them in the air and expect them to form a building themselves.</p>
<p>Instead, one component should be planned.This approach has two notable advantages, both when replacing an existing system and when building from scratch.</p>
<p>First, when deploying a software product, we fall into the zone of the cumulative technical risk embodied in the software code.With consecutive component-by-component deployment, this technical risk is distributed over a longer period of time.Each component has its own chance of failing when put into operation, allowing us to create the components individually.</p>
<p>Secondly, sequential deployment forces us to create clearly defined interfaces between components.The deployment of one component of a new system often involves its reintegration with the old system.Therefore, by the time the deployment is completed, each component will have time to work with two different systems: the original and the replacement.Component-by-component deployment thus automatically improves the ability to reuse components.In practice, this also leads to increased coherence and reduced coupling.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in a number of important aspects the analogy with construction does not work. In particular, the materiality of the real world reinforces the role of preliminary planning, forcing us to use the waterfall method.After all, no one starts building a skyscraper without knowing in advance how much space it will take and how many floors it will have.Adding floors to an existing building is too expensive and risky, so we try to avoid such extremes.The location or height of the once-designed skyscraper should no longer be changed.The skyscrapers are not scalable.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t easily expand the road with new tracks, but we know how to easily include new features in the program.It&rsquo;s not a defect in the development process, it&rsquo;s the dignity of the environment in which we work.Nothing prevents us from releasing an app with minimal functionality if users value these features enough to pay for them.In practice, the earlier you release your application, the higher the net value of the outcome.</p>
<p>At first glance, the early release contradicts the step-by-step deployment approach, but in reality they are very well combined.Early release of individual components means that each component can undergo iterative development independently of the other components.Moreover, this approach will force you to work through issues such as continuous availability during deployment and version control of protocols.</p>
<p>Methods that provide higher commercial value combined with improved architectural qualities are rare, but early deployment of individual components has both advantages.</p>
