    <p>Too often, software architects live in ivory towers, leaving specifications to the developers and imposing technologies and directions on them. At the same time, this leads to strife, which is quickly followed by a “popular uprising.&quot; The result is a software product that has nothing to do with the original requirements. Every software architect must be able to explain to his colleagues the goals and objectives of the software project. The keys to effective communication are clarity and leadership.</p>
<p>Clearness characterizes the process of communication. No one in your group will read a 100-page document justifying your architectural decisions. The ability to express your thoughts clearly is vital to the success of any program or project. From the very beginning of work on the project, adhere to simple explanations and, in no case, start making long descriptions in Word. Use tools like Visio to create simple charts that explain your ideas. Diagrams should be simple because they will change almost frequently. Informal meetings are another effective means of disseminating information. The best way to communicate your thoughts to the project participants is to bring together a group of developers (or other architects) in one room and display your ideas on the board. Be sure to take a digital camera with you (nothing is more annoying than the requirement to release the conference room when you have just finished drawing). After the meeting, take a picture, multiply it, and distribute it to the rest of the participants via wiki. Postpone the creation of spacious documents and focus on bringing your ideas to colleagues, and then you can think of a more detailed presentation of your architectural solutions.</p>
<p>Most software architects do not realize that they must also be leaders. To work in a healthy and productive environment, you, as a leader, must win the respect of your colleagues. Keeping developers unaware of what the overall picture looks like and why certain decisions are made is the right path to disaster. On the contrary, by attracting developers to your side, you create a collective working environment in which the correctness of your architectural decisions is checked. In turn, connecting designers to the architecture creation process ensures their commitment and interest.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that clarity and leadership are important for interacting with all team members (not only with developers but also with the testing team, business analysts, and project managers). Clear communication and effective leadership enhance the quality of communication and create a strong and healthy working environment.</p>
<p>If “communication is the king,&quot;  then clarity and leadership are its true allies.</p>
