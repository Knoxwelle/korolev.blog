    <p>Too often, software architects live in ivory towers, prescribing to developers the technologies and procedures to follow while providing them with little or no assistance. This simultaneously leads to conflict and, shortly after, a &ldquo;popular uprising.&rdquo; The final result is a piece of software that is completely unrelated to the initial requirements. Any software architect must be able to clearly communicate the goals and objectives of the software project to his peers. Leadership and clarity are prerequisites for effective communication.</p>
<p>a method of communication that is precise and short. Nobody in your group will read a hundred-page booklet outlining your architectural decisions. Every program or endeavor must have effective concept communication in order to be successful. When you first start working on the project, don&rsquo;t start writing long-word descriptions; instead, stick to succinct explanations. Make simple charts with tools like Visio to help you visualize your ideas. Diagrams need to be simple because they will change almost continuously. Informal get-togethers are still another effective means of knowledge exchange. The best way to communicate your ideas to project participants is to gather developers or other architects in a room and write them on a board. Nothing is more annoying than having to leave the conference room after you&rsquo;ve completed designing, so a digital camera is a necessity. After the meeting, snap a picture, make it larger, and send it to the other participants via wiki. Delay writing lengthy documents and focus on talking with colleagues about your ideas. You can develop a more comprehensive presentation of your architectural solutions in the future.</p>
<p>Many software architects are not aware that they also have to be leaders. To operate in a supportive and productive environment, you, as a leader, must earn the respect of your team. Without understanding the big picture and the rationale behind decisions, developers are bound to find themselves in a terrible situation. Rather, by rallying developers to your cause, you create a shared workspace where the correctness of your architectural decisions is confirmed. Involving designers in the architectural process ensures their commitment and interest.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that leadership and clarity are necessary for efficient communication with all team members, including the testing team, business analysts, and project managers. Effective leadership and clear communication, which both enhance communication quality, create strong and healthy work environments.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;communication is king,&rdquo; then true friends of it would be clarity and leadership.</p>
