    <p>People often think that making the best decision is what matters most when presented with options.This is untrue in design, whether it be software products or anything else. An analysis of the uncertainty in the system&rsquo;s design is necessary when an alternative exists. Use breakdown and abstraction to lessen the significance of design decisions, or use uncertainty as a deciding factor to find areas where you can delay the transition to specifics.It&rsquo;s conceivable that you&rsquo;ll tie your hands later if you blindly &ldquo;sew&rdquo; whatever decision comes to mind into the system.As a result, the software product&rsquo;s flexibility will decline and random judgments will start to take center stage.</p>
<p>Grady Booch provided one of the clearest and most helpful definitions of architecture, saying that &ldquo;though not all designs are intended to result in architecture, all architecture is the product of design.&rdquo; The system&rsquo;s architecture represents the key design decisions that have shaped it; the significance of these decisions is based on the expense of making adjustments.&ldquo;Thus, an architecture that generally minimizes the significance of design choices is efficient.This becomes more crucial in cases of inefficient architecture.The architect needs to take a backseat if a design solution leads down either of the two routes.He should consider asking himself, &ldquo;How do I build a solution that lessen the relevance of a choice between alternatives &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B,&rdquo; rather than having to decide between possibilities A and B. The important part of this circumstance is not whether A or B is the better option—rather, it&rsquo;s the fact that there is an option at all (and that the best option isn&rsquo;t always clear-cut or unchanging).</p>
<p>An architect may need to move about a while before he becomes aware of a contradiction. Are you and a coworker standing at the board, fervently debating several options?Are you purposefully splattering &ldquo;M-m-m&rdquo; and &ldquo;E-e-e&rdquo; all over the code, frantically trying out different combinations? You are faced with ambiguity when a new demand or clarification of an existing requirement raises doubts about the practicality of the current implementation. What is our response to it? Consider using separation or encapsulation to separate a decision from the code that ultimately depends on that decision. The alternative to this is frequently the ambiguous code, which sounds like someone who is anxious during an interview and tries to make up for the lack of clarity by making a lot of assumptions and using common terms. Furthermore, if the decision is taken with a strong but misplaced confidence, the project will quickly and blindly go in the incorrect direction.</p>
<p>Make no decision at all if there is any doubt regarding the many ways to develop the system. Delay making a decision for a while until it can be made more responsibly based on accurate information, but don&rsquo;t wait too long to avoid putting that information to waste.</p>
<p>Since the design process and architecture are closely related, the architect should prioritize design cycles and empirical architectural approaches that offer feedback. This will allow the architect to constructively use uncertainty to divide the system into its component parts and schedule its design.</p>
