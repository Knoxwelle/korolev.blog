In general, the interviewer had a list of questions, but he allowed himself to deviate a little from it, which gave some liveliness to the conversation.

<h2 id="devopssre">DevOps/SRE</h2>
<p>I was unemployed and full of time, so I decided to interview DevOps. In vain that the course on Linux was held on Udemy (a joke, sarcasm, still passed, but to write about it is embarrassing)?! And then I liked the process much more. It consisted of only two steps: general knowledge and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>In general, the interviewer had a list of questions, but he allowed himself to deviate a little from it, which gave some liveliness to the conversation. We&rsquo;ve had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, container operation, and databases. In general, what happens in the universe one way or another? Maybe not so profoundly, but some baccalaureate could have answered them. In the end, the interlocutor learned something new, and I wrote out a couple of items to read.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting was a role-playing game. There is a system, and users complain that the site does not load. You don&rsquo;t have notebooks or dashboards; you&rsquo;ve only got a sensible jungle that can be commanded to do or see something. At least it was fun and as close as possible to real work. The problem isn&rsquo;t complicated, but it&rsquo;s only been an hour. And the scientific method here loses to empirical observations. The SRE must have some sense of what&rsquo;s going on in the system, which was being produced at the time of the incident.</p>
