<meta name="twitter:description" content="For many of us, a career as an architect began with some purely technical position where success was primarily determined by the ability to communicate with computers.

Whether you discuss the advantages of a particular template with developers or explain to management the pros and cons of purchasing middleware, the key to success lies in your communication skills.
Objectively measuring the degree of an architect&rsquo;s influence on a project is quite difficult, but one thing is clear: if developers constantly ignore the architect&rsquo;s instructions and management does not pay attention to his recommendations, the &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of the architect&rsquo;s actions will not affect the development of his career in any way.">

    <p>For many of us, a career as an architect began with some purely technical position where success was primarily determined by the ability to communicate with computers. However, in the role of an architect, we primarily have to communicate with other people. Whether you discuss the advantages of a particular template with developers or explain to management the pros and cons of purchasing middleware, the key to success lies in your communication skills.</p>
<p>Objectively measuring the degree of an architect&rsquo;s influence on a project is quite difficult, but one thing is clear: if developers constantly ignore the architect&rsquo;s instructions and management does not pay attention to his recommendations, the &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of the architect&rsquo;s actions will not affect the development of his career in any way. Experienced architects understand that they must &ldquo;promote&rdquo; their ideas, and this task requires the ability to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>On the topic of interpersonal communication, many books have been written, but I would like to
to present to your attention a simple and practical technique that
will radically enhance the effectiveness of your communication and thereby strengthen your success as an architect. In whatever situation you may find yourself
to explain your position to several listeners at once, stand up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are – at the official system project analysis
or an informal discussion of a couple of diagrams. Stand up – especially if
everyone else is sitting.</p>
<p>When you stand up, those around you automatically start perceiving you.
as an authoritative and self-confident person. You become the center
attention. You will be interrupted less often. All of this will have a significant impact on the discussion, regardless of whether your recommendations are accepted.
or not.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that a standing person uses more intensively
gestures and facial expressions. If you are communicating with a group of 10 or more people, standing up will help establish eye contact with the entire audience.
Eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, and other visual elements play an important role in communication. Moreover, standing position changes
tone and volume of voice, as well as speech tempo: you start speaking
so that you can be heard in a large room, making pauses to highlight important moments. All these elements make a significant contribution
in the effectiveness of communication.</p>
<p>Do you want to improve the effectiveness of conveying your ideas in the process of communication?
more than twice? It&rsquo;s very simple: just stand up and speak only while standing.</p>
