    <p>The natural evolution of computer technology has led to important changes in the tools that architects use to create computer systems.These changes have revived interest in multilingual programming, i.e. the use of multiple languages as the core in the implementation of the software system.</p>
<p>The concept of multilingual programming is not new; a typical example from the past is systems in which the client part is written in Visual Basic and uses the server part based on COM objects written in C ++.In fact, this architecture effectively exploited the strengths of each of the languages mentioned in the zenith of their popularity.What changes have revived interest in multilingual programming?New technical standards, combined with a steady increase in resources – channel bandwidth and computing capacity – have made real use of text protocols possible. Those times, when effective distributed systems were only possible with the use of cunning binary protocols, are a thing of the past.Remote text-level interaction emerged with XML/SOAP-based web services and continues to evolve towards REST architectural styles and other auxiliary (but no less important) protocols such as Atom and XMPP.</p>
<p>With this new generation of technologies, we have much more opportunities for heterogeneous development than ever before, simply because useful information is now formatted text that can be generated and processed with universal means.Heterogeneous design allows you to choose the most suitable tool for each particular task, and the ability of systems to interact at the text level overcomes many of the previous obstacles.</p>
<p>Now architects can combine specialized, powerful tools to speak not about the ability to apply the right language, but about applying the right paradigm.Programming languages support different paradigms, some of which are object-oriented, while others are functional or parallel programming oriented.For specific tasks or subject areas, some of these paradigms would be perfect, while others would be inappropriate. Nowadays, however, these unconventional (and seemingly heterogeneous) tools are combined into elegant hybrid solutions much easier than before.</p>
<p>The effect of these changes is already visible in the combinatory increase in the complexity of the architectural topology of modern software systems.This aspect is not so much a reflection of their inherent diversity, but a sign of new opportunities.</p>
<p>Choice is not always useful, but in this case it is the &ldquo;lesser evil&rdquo; in the context of modern software architectures.Our industry is facing very serious challenges1, so we need all the opportunities for interaction that can be provided, especially if the platforms currently in use are not very well suited to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the work of an architect has become even more difficult because of the fact that the boundaries of technology are tearing under the pressure of new possibilities.Accept this challenge, learn to think broadly and turn the wealth of opportunities in your favour: heterogeneity wins.</p>
