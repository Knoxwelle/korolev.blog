    <p>We architects want to know how good the program we&rsquo;re working on is.The quality of the program has an obvious external aspect – the program must be of value to the user – but it also has a more subtle internal aspect relating to the clarity of the design – to how easy it is for us to understand, support, and expand the software product.When we are insisted on defining quality, we usually end up saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out when I see it.&ldquo;But how do you see quality?</p>
<p>Small squares on architectural charts represent entire systems, and the lines between them can signify anything: dependencies, data streams, or shared resources (e.g. a rail).<br>
These diagrams depict the system from a height of 10 kilometers, approximately the same scale as we see the landscape from an airplane.The only alternative, as a rule, is the source code, which can be compared to the surface view.Both concepts are incapable of conveying any substantial information about the quality of the software product: one is too high, and the other</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so overloaded with details that you can&rsquo;t see the structure behind it.Obviously, there is a lack of an intermediate option – view from a height of 300 meters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;View from 300 meters&rdquo; provides information at the right level. It combines large volumes of data and different metrics (number of methods, number of dependencies1, cyclomatic complexity1).How this will be presented in practice depends heavily on the specific aspect of quality.It can be a visual representation of a dependency graph, a histogram showing metrics at the class level, or a complex polymetric view showing the relationships of different input values.</p>
<p>Creating such representations manually and keeping them synchronized with the program is hopeless occupation.We need tools that are capable of creating such representations based on the only reliable source of information – the source code.For some representations, for example for a design structure matrix, there are commercial tools, but specialized representations are surprisingly easy to create by combining small data and metrics extraction tools with common visualization packages.A simple example: a Checkstyle output (in fact, a set of metric levels of classes and methods) is loaded into a spreadsheet to build charts.The same metrics can be displayed in the TreeMap format using the InfoViz tool.GraphViz is also an excellent tool for displaying graphs of complex dependencies.</p>
<p>Once a suitable representation is found, the quality of the software product begins to be perceived less subjectively.It is possible to compare the product being developed with other similar systems.Comparison of different versions of a system allows to identify trends, and comparison of representations of different subsystems can reveal sharp deviations from the norm.Even with a single chart we can rely on our aesthetic sense and the ability to notice patterns.A well-balanced tree is likely to reflect a successful hierarchy of classes; a harmonious set of rectangles can represent code organized as classes of the right size.In most cases, a very simple principle works: what looks good is most likely well arranged.</p>
