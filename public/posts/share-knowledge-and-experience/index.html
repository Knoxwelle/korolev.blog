    <p>From all our endeavors, both successful and unsuccessful, we derive a lot of valuable lessons.In such a young industry as software development, the sharing of experience and knowledge is vital for progress.What any of the teams learns in their tiny corner of the world can impact the work of their colleagues across the globe.</p>
<p>If we look at things realistically, our foundation of fundamental (that is, absolute and theoretically true) knowledge about software development is small compared to what is necessary for the successful advancement of a project. To compensate for this lack of knowledge, we make guesses, rely on intuition, and sometimes even just choose randomly. Thus, during any major software development project, empirical data emerges about what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Step by step, we accumulate experience from changes that we want to apply to the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>At an individual level, each of us strives to enhance our qualifications and understand how to build increasingly larger systems.The tasks that our profession itself sets before us will continuously become more complex, and in solving them, we want to be guided by our previous experience.However, to extract the maximum benefit from the acquired experience, it is often necessary to bring it to a rational level.The best and simplest way to do this is to try to explain it to another person.</p>
<p>The process of discussion always helps to identify the weaknesses of the subject being discussed. You can&rsquo;t say that you understand something if you can&rsquo;t easily explain it. Only when we articulate our explanations and discuss them with others does our experience transform into knowledge.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if we have gained some experience, the conclusions drawn from it may not be entirely correct in a broader context. Perhaps we were not as successful or as smart as we would like to believe. Of course, testing our knowledge in real conditions is frightening, especially when something valuable to us turns out to be a myth, a mistake, or a misconception; being wrong is always unpleasant.</p>
<p>We are all human, so what happens in our minds is not always right, and not every thought that arises is rational.Only when we recognize our imperfections does the path to improvement open up before us. The old saying &ldquo;One learns from mistakes&rdquo; is still true.If our ideas and beliefs do not stand up to the test of discussion, it is better to find this out before we base our decisions on them.</p>
<p>By sharing the knowledge and experience we have gained, we contribute to the advancement of our industry; we recognize that this also helps us better understand what is happening and correct mistakes. Given the state of many of our programs, it is crucial to seize every opportunity to share with others what we have understood, learned, or believe we have learned. If we help those around us improve, they will help us fully realize our potential.</p>
