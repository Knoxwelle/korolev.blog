    <p>In terms of design, the collection is no longer the &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; for the project. Architects must encourage the implementation of continuous integration methodologies and technology in all projects, at the corporate and application levels.</p>
<p>The term continuous integration (CI) was first proposed by Martin Fowler as a design template. It describes a set of methods and tools that ensure reliable, automated application testing and assembly across short time intervals (often on an integration server designed to do these functions). These days, all software projects must use continuous integration, which blends automated assembly tools with modular testing methods and resources.</p>
<p>Now that the project&rsquo;s components have been assembled, they have been tested. Continuous integration now occupies the space previously occupied by &ldquo;early and frequent assembly.&rdquo; Although assembly is still required, it now has extra capabilities that improve developer collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>The most well-known feature of continuous integration is assembly, which is usually carried out automatically.Although manual building is still an option, you can now schedule a build process to run every night or anytime you make changes to the source code. At the start of the compilation process, the continuous integration tool pulls the latest version of the source code from the repository and tries to compile and test the project. The process concludes with notifications detailing the results. Notifications can be received via email or instant messaging apps, among other methods.</p>
<p>Continuous integration leads to a more concentrated and reliable development process. This will appeal to you as an architect, but more importantly, continuous integration will increase the output of your development teams and your company overall.</p>
