<meta name="twitter:description" content="The fate of fate I started to go to interviews again, and I want to share some observations. On this, I just give advice to everyone in enterprise companies about how the recruitment process should be structured.
Advice to candidates In the last five years, I&rsquo;ve been through several hundred interviews on both sides. So, some life hacking:
You&rsquo;re going to have to go through the windshields. Those you&rsquo;re not going to go to. You pump the skill, or suddenly something interesting turns out to be, or it&rsquo;ll be the only place with the offer. You never know what&rsquo;s in a box of candy.
Get some sleep and let yourself rest on the day of wrath. The same live coding is quite a dumb thing; the solution may not come during the call but will appear immediately after.">

    <p>The fate of fate I started to go to interviews again, and I want to share some observations. On this, I just give advice to everyone in enterprise companies about how the recruitment process should be structured.</p>
<h2 id="advice-to-candidates">Advice to candidates</h2>
<p>In the last five years, I&rsquo;ve been through several hundred interviews on both sides. So, some life hacking:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to go through the windshields. Those you&rsquo;re not going to go to. You pump the skill, or suddenly something interesting turns out to be, or it&rsquo;ll be the only place with the offer. You never know what&rsquo;s in a box of candy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get some sleep and let yourself rest on the day of wrath. The same live coding is quite a dumb thing; the solution may not come during the call but will appear immediately after.</li>
<li>Take a glass of water. Drink in any unclear situation; it is a good and adequate filler.</li>
<li>Talk to me. It&rsquo;s good if you can talk to your cat or colleague about distracted topics before the call. It helps relieve some tension.</li>
<li>Take it easy. If they don&rsquo;t take you, nobody dies. Yeah, maybe it&rsquo;ll be harder, but in a year or two, you&rsquo;ll even say &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; This attitude will help reduce the degree of stiffness a little.</li>
<li>Be sure to ask for feedback. Without feedback, it&rsquo;s very hard to learn.
I would like to remind you that refusal should be treated more easily. You just didn&rsquo;t fit this company for that position. It doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad person or a programmer. I received refusals with such words as &ldquo;overqualified&rdquo; and &ldquo;we thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the penny against quater,&rdquo; just flowers. Well, they don&rsquo;t have a job for me, maybe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advice-to-interviewers">Advice to interviewers</h2>
<p>More empathy. You are not a candidate, but a potential colleague. And you have no purpose in overthrowing him; your task is to understand if he can perform the duties that he will have and if it is comfortable for you to communicate. It&rsquo;s impossible to do that in an hour and a half.</p>
<h2 id="instead-of-conviction">Instead of conviction</h2>
<p>In my 10 years in IT, I have worked for many types of companies. They were mainly start-ups or small companies with 20–30 people. So, the interviews at the enterprise are strikingly different from theirs. Recruiters have a huge flow of vacancies and resumes, so wild options are possible at first sight. For example, after seven successful interviews, I was told that they could not find a position for me. WTF?! But as an excuse, I can say that they have streaming hiring. I mean, they&rsquo;re screwing everybody, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going to figure it out someday.&rdquo; And the processes are fully standardized. Whether you&rsquo;re a senior in Python with 15 years of referral experience or not, you still go through all the hell stages.</p>
