    <p>Many of us started our careers as architects in some form of very technical role where computer communication skills were essential to succeed.However, our primary means of communication as architects is with other people. Your ability to communicate effectively is essential for success, whether you are arguing with developers about the benefits of using a template or outlining the advantages and disadvantages of purchasing intermediary software to management.</p>
<p>It is challenging to measure the architect&rsquo;s influence on the project objectively, but one thing is certain: the &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of the architect&rsquo;s actions will not have an impact on the trajectory of his career if the developers consistently disregard his instructions and the management does not value his advice. Skilled architects know that they must &ldquo;promote&rdquo; their concepts, and good communication is necessary for this.</p>
<p>Numerous books have been written about interpersonal communication, but I want to share with you one easy-to-implement method that will significantly boost your communication skills and, in turn, support your success as an architect.Get up whenever you have to defend your position in front of multiple people at once.It makes no difference if you&rsquo;re at a casual conversation of two charts or a formal system project study. Particularly if everyone else is seated, get up.</p>
<p>People immediately start to view you as an authoritative and self-assured person when you stand up. You&rsquo;re starting to command attention. There&rsquo;s a decreased chance of interruptions. Whether or whether your suggestions are adopted, all of this will have a big influence on the conversation.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that someone who is standing makes more intense use of gestures and mimics. Making eye contact with the entire audience when speaking to a gathering of ten or more people can be facilitated by rising up. In communication, optical contact, gestures, mimics, and other visual cues are crucial. Furthermore, speaking while standing modifies the pitch, loudness, and cadence of your speech. You begin speaking in a loud environment by pausing to emphasize key points in your speech. Each of these components significantly adds to the efficacy of communication.
Would you like to communicate your views more effectively than twice?</p>
