Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle?

Why did that happen? Because the developers chose Ruby instead of Java or Python instead of Smalltalk? Because you decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? Or because you preferred the Windows platform, even though you should have chosen Linux? As you know, all failures of projects are usually blamed on technology. But was your task really so complex that the Java capabilities were not enough for it?<br>
Projects are usually created by people, and it is these people that determine the success or failure of the whole project.And once that&rsquo;s the case, we need to think a little bit about how to help them succeed.<br>
Per there is someone in the team who, from your point of view, is not doing his job and hindering the success of the project. The technology used to solve such problems is very old and time-tested; in fact, it is the most important technological achievement in human history. What you need is communication.<br>
At the same time, simply possessing the techniques of communication as a technology is not enough. Respect for people, the ability to give them credit of trust are essential skills that turn a smart leader into an effective.<br>
Of course, the matter is not exhausted, but a few simple tips will significantly increase the effectiveness of your communication with subordinates:<br>
• Consider the discussion of problems as a constructive dialogue rather than a conflict situation.
Start from positive assumptions about people and view communication as an opportunity to ask questions that interest you; so you will definitely be able to get more useful information, and your interlocutors will not take a defensive position.<br>
• Start the conversation only in a mood suitable for communication.<br>
If you are angry, irritated, upset and out of balance in general, your interlocutor is likely to interpret your non-verbal manifestations as a sign of attack.<br>
• Use situations such as an opportunity to mutual benefit.<br>
Don&rsquo;t tell the developer to be quiet at meetings because he doesn&rsquo;t let anyone talk; ask him if he can help you get involved in other people&rsquo;s discussions.Explain that an introvert needs a longer break to start a conversation, and if he holds a five-second break before he pronounces the first words, it will help you a lot.<br>
If you are focused on a common goal, view the “problems” of your interlocutors as an opportunity to learn something, manage your emotions, you will not only improve your efficiency, but will also learn something new every time.</p>
