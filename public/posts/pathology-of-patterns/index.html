    <p>Design patterns are one of the most useful tools in the software architect&rsquo;s arsenal.The use of templates allows for the creation of standard solutions that are easier to understand and explain to others.The very idea of templates is directly associated with quality design.Because of this, we often feel tempted to showcase our expertise by incorporating a large number of templates into the project.If you find yourself stubbornly trying to fit your favorite patterns into a task where they don&rsquo;t belong, it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to pattern pathology.</p>
<p>Many projects suffer from such a situation.Looking at them, you can almost see the architect of the project lifting his gaze from the last page of the template collection, rubbing his hands together and saying, &ldquo;So, which template shall we start with?..&quot;.This way of acting is somewhat akin to the approach of a developer who starts writing a class with the thought: &ldquo;Hmm, which class should I inherit from&hellip;?&rdquo; Design patterns are an excellent tool for reducing inherent complexity, but like any other tool, they can be misused.There is a well-known proverb: &ldquo;A man with a hammer sees nails everywhere&rdquo;; when design patterns take on the role of that hammer, problems are inevitable.Make sure that your love for templates does not turn into an obsession that leads to implementing more complex solutions than are truly necessary.</p>
<p>Templates are not a panacea, and their use does not always indicate good design.They are merely reusable solutions to typical problems, found and described by other developers, so that it is easier for us to recognize the &ldquo;already invented bicycle&rdquo; if we come across it.Our task is to identify the problems for which these solutions were created and to correctly apply the appropriate design template.Don&rsquo;t let your desire to showcase your mastery of design patterns take precedence over pragmatism.Focus your efforts on designing systems that provide effective solutions to business challenges, and use templates to address the specific problems for which they are intended.</p>
