<meta name="twitter:description" content="Since Lord Nelson destroyed the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805, the principle of &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; has become the main mantra for solving complex, intricate problems. Another, more familiar term with the same meaning is separation of concerns.The division of responsibility leads to encapsulation, and encapsulation contributes to the delineation of boundaries and interfaces.
If we look at the task through the eyes of an architect, the most challenging part is finding natural places to establish boundaries and determining suitable interfaces necessary for creating a functional system.This is especially difficult to achieve in large corporate systems, where natural boundaries are often very few, and various subject areas are closely intertwined.In such situations, traditional principles like &ldquo;minimize coupling, maximize cohesion&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cut where intensive information exchange is needed&rdquo; are somewhat helpful; however, they do not provide guidance on how to effectively communicate information about tasks and potential solutions to stakeholders.">

<p>If we look at the task through the eyes of an architect, the most challenging part is finding natural places to establish boundaries and determining suitable interfaces necessary for creating a functional system.This is especially difficult to achieve in large corporate systems, where natural boundaries are often very few, and various subject areas are closely intertwined.In such situations, traditional principles like &ldquo;minimize coupling, maximize cohesion&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cut where intensive information exchange is needed&rdquo; are somewhat helpful; however, they do not provide guidance on how to effectively communicate information about tasks and potential solutions to stakeholders.</p>
<p>Here, the concept of bounded contexts and context maps, described by Eric Evans in his book &ldquo;Domain-Driven Design&rdquo; (Addison-Wesley Professional), comes to the rescue.A bounded context refers to an area of unique definition of a model or concept; in diagrams, it is depicted as a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; with a meaningful name that defines its role or task in the subject area. For example, the transportation system may include contexts such as &ldquo;Shipping,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shipping Planning,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Movements within the port.&ldquo;In other subject areas, other names will emerge.</p>
<p>After you have identified the limited contexts and applied them to the board, the next step is to define the connections between the contexts.These connections may reflect organizational, functional, or technical dependencies. As a result, a context map is created – a collection of contexts and the interfaces between them.</p>
<p>The context map becomes a useful tool in the hands of the architect, helping to focus on which components should be kept together and which need to be separated from one another; in other words, the principle of &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; is visually implemented.This technique can be easily used both for documenting and analyzing the current situation, as well as for redesigning with the aim of creating a system that has loose coupling, high cohesion, and clearly defined interfaces.</p>
