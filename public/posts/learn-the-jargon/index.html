    <p>In any profession there is its jargon, increasing the effectiveness of communication of the representatives of this profession.Lawyers talk to each other about Habeas Corpus, Voir Dire and Venire, carpenters talk about connectionsx connections and infiltration and impregnation, and software architects talk about ROA, two-stage presentation and supertypes of levels&hellip;Wait a minute&hellip; what, excuse me?</p>
<p>It is very important that software architects, regardless of the platform on which they work, have effective means of communicating with each other.One such tool is architectural templates and design templates.To work effectively as an architect, you need to understand the basic architectural patterns and design templates, to distinguish them in code, to know when they are applied, and to be able to use them in conversation with other architects and developers.</p>
<p>Architectural and design templates can be divided into four main categories: enterprise-level templates, application-level Templates, integration templates and design Templates.These categories are usually defined by the level of abstraction of the pattern in the general architecture.Corporate-level templates relate to high-level architecture, whereas design templates refer to the structure and behavior of individual components of the overall architecture.</p>
<p>Corporate-level patterns define the framework of high-level architecture.The most common architectural patterns are Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Service-Oriented architecture (SOA), Resource Oriented Architecture and Pipeline Architecture.</p>
<p>Application level templates describe the design of an application or subsystem in the context of a larger corporate architecture.This category includes well-known J2EE templates (e.g. Session Facade and Transfer Object), as well as templates described in Martin Fowler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&rdquo; (Addison-Wesley Professional).</p>
<p>Integration templates play an important role in designing and describing concepts related to how components, applications and subsystems share information and functionality.Here are some examples of integration templates: File sharing, remote procedure calls, various message patterns.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the basic patterns from the &ldquo;Band Four&rdquo; book &ldquo;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&rdquo; (Addison-Wesley Professio nal) is a must for every architect.At first glance, these templates may seem to be too low for a software product architect, but they are part of the vocabulary that allows architects and developers to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>The architect must also know and understand the essence of different antipatterns.Antipatterns (the term was introduced by Andrew Koenig) are recurring processes that lead to ineffective results. Here are well-known examples of antipatterns: Analysis Paralysis, Design By Committee, Mushroom Management, Death March.Knowing these patterns will help you avoid many typical mistakes.</p>
<p>Software architects should be able to communicate with each other in a clear, concise and effective way.Patterns come to our aid; we architects only have to study and understand them.</p>
