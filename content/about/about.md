Hi, I am Stan,

I was born in Sochi, but since 2018 I have been living in Vancouver, British Columbia. Who am I?

**Software Developer** with expertise in all aspects of enterprise-grade commercial architecture standards. **Software Automation** expert responsible for delivering software quality via regression in CI/CD pipeline, directing teams for performance. AWS certified. Ph.D.

Once a month, I go somewhere. Not for work, but because I love traveling. I write rather superficially and briefly, depending on my mood. Even though I fly a lot on airplanes, I will not write here about how to choose a seat on a plane, accumulate miles, or transfer to business class. I’ll leave this antimony to other penmen. What I will definitely write about is a career in IT and the problems of relationships with technology, code, and working processes in development, meaningless notes about life, and thousands of ways to climb Mount Fuji.

If you like what I write about, email me [korolevst@gmail.com](mailto:korolevst@gmail.com). I’m always interested to know how people find this blog.
