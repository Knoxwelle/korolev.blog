The fate of fate I started to go to interviews again, and I want to share some observations. On this, I just give advice to everyone in enterprise companies about how the recruitment process should be structured.

## Advice to candidates

In the last five years, I've been through several hundred interviews on both sides. So, some life hacking:

You're going to have to go through the windshields. Those you're not going to go to. You pump the skill, or suddenly something interesting turns out to be, or it'll be the only place with the offer. You never know what's in a box of candy.

 - Get some sleep and let yourself rest on the day of wrath. The same live coding is quite a dumb thing; the solution may not come during the call but will appear immediately after.
- Take a glass of water. Drink in any unclear situation; it is a good and adequate filler.
- Talk to me. It's good if you can talk to your cat or colleague about distracted topics before the call. It helps relieve some tension.
- Take it easy. If they don't take you, nobody dies. Yeah, maybe it'll be harder, but in a year or two, you'll even say "thank you." This attitude will help reduce the degree of stiffness a little.
- Be sure to ask for feedback. Without feedback, it's very hard to learn.
   I would like to remind you that refusal should be treated more easily. You just didn't fit this company for that position. It doesn't make you a bad person or a programmer. I received refusals with such words as "overqualified" and "we thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the penny against quater," just flowers. Well, they don't have a job for me, maybe.

## Advice to interviewers

More empathy. You are not a candidate, but a potential colleague. And you have no purpose in overthrowing him; your task is to understand if he can perform the duties that he will have and if it is comfortable for you to communicate. It's impossible to do that in an hour and a half.

## Instead of conviction

In my 10 years in IT, I have worked for many types of companies. They were mainly start-ups or small companies with 20â€“30 people. So, the interviews at the enterprise are strikingly different from theirs. Recruiters have a huge flow of vacancies and resumes, so wild options are possible at first sight. For example, after seven successful interviews, I was told that they could not find a position for me. WTF?! But as an excuse, I can say that they have streaming hiring. I mean, they're screwing everybody, "and we're going to figure it out someday." And the processes are fully standardized. Whether you're a senior in Python with 15 years of referral experience or not, you still go through all the hell stages.
