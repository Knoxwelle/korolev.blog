I would want to share some insights from my recent return to interviewing. This episode covers employment process design and screening in large organizations.

## Examining

Tech-screening then takes off like wildfire. The recruiter checks in with Sparkling and asks a ton of questions during the first call. As an example:

-How is it possible to halt the container?
The original data types in Python?
What is the PID of the Linux kernel?
How are PACELC and CAP understood?
- -...


 Some even go so far as to use tiny executable pieces of code to create an entire platform. Twenty queries in twenty minutes. "How do I send a message to the generator?" Or even "What does this code do?" He knows that the code is so strange that I wouldn't just ignore it in a review. Yes, I did notice that the reason we get a negative is because the second argument in sorted is merely named. I confirmed that the system doesn't care what Google completes in twenty-five seconds.

Do you intend to host screenings of this nature? On the Skytrain, I heard one such unusual conversation. But even recruiters seem tired of outsiders applying for every available job without any prior knowledge of the company.

But roughly 20 percent of them had realized the power of the calendar at the same time. For whatever reason, they think the conversation ends when someone says, "I made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm; here's the link..." No, go away! Schedule! Given that I

-I'll pick a time slot; I'll be forgetful; I'll break links; and I'll count for sixty minutes instead of sixty.
I don't get to know the other person right away.
- and it was typically at 1:30 pm UTC (not PST).

There needs to be a prerequisite exam for hiring a recruiter. " Oh, "Oh, free all day" (and quiet, too...). Moreover, if you request a move because of illness, you will not be remembered at all. With the calendar, there won't be as many Fridays.

## Real-Time Coding

There's generally a lot of noise around him. Some people enjoy the process (interviews), some people find it unpleasant (candidates), and one individual continues to visit a psychologist for six months following the interview. Since there aren't nearly enough large-scale projects, code-filled profile pieces, or reports on Github, it's not really evident from this that the candidate can code. I was informed that this is to ensure that all candidates receive the same treatment throughout the hiring process. At the second, he'll ask himself, "Do I really need this?" It expires since there are currently three offers.

You usually have two tasks to finish. Sure, turn the trees around. Please understand what a rifle is. When you go back later, they won't have any trees at all. Each task has a designated hour. Also, a lot will depend on the other individual and the course of this hour. Since the applicant is still under duress, there are people who help rationalize, create the IDE, create a two-point, and, should they be disregarded, offer some measure of compassion and support. Take care of them! Far more often than not, I run into people who don't even turn on their cameras. All they do is give it an assignment and watch what it does. In one of these sessions, I finished a three-hour work. (No.) "Because you probably have a choice, so we're not going to communicate." Wonderful ~{fail~~win!

With one Canadian, I had the most exciting live-coding experience I've ever had. We literally authored the first part jointly, me writing the more complex second and him writing the first. That's when I realized there was another problem with this session: it was quite one-sided. We have a co-interview at the end of the day. Can they code as well? Working at "Big4" doesn't always involve this.

It is also expected of students to work on O(1) problems at a respectable organization; the amount of additional RAM is not important. It makes sense why their app weighs so much, but it still breaks. The intricacy is that, in practice, implementing and maintaining such code is far more difficult due to synchronization problems with these similar data structures. As it occurs, the interview turns into an Olympiad, and that's where the luck comes in; if you slept, you ought to have thought of a way out; if not, you woke up early and had no luck at all.

The interviewer's lack of preparation may also be the reason behind people's distaste for internet programming. Encoding occurs even on a laptop with a scratched screen. Naturally, online editors are the most popular; syntax illumination is a great feature. But you have to come up with a task to find another half-business like that. The most bizarre things I had were the white screen and the message "Transfer money from account A to account B." Not even an interface, not even a template, not even a proposal for the BD... For ten minutes, all you do is tell them what they want to see. Consider taking writing classes. Which domains? In summary, all of this support code isn't very task-related.

What steps do we need to take right now? What piqued my curiosity the most was the subject of the PR talk. Here, one can tell how someone will behave in a professional context straight away without having to use irony. What he is paying attention to, what he ignores, and why. For example, since formatting is the responsibility of linters, gentlemen typically pay less attention to it and concentrate more on APIs, races, and working optimally with the base. I really advise trying it out.

## Architecture of the System

System design interviews are another type of interview that occurs in the senior year. You have an hour to create a system; however, in a real project, it would take weeks to think out the architecture. Forget these intimidating terms: IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, and BPMN. There is no time for them. Figac-figac and proudakshen. Gathering requirements, analyzing them, presenting the solution, and determining use cases and system requirements all take time. Here, the most crucial things are rather simple: to give Kafka a place to stay and a cunning face. They'll be behind you in forty minutes.

## Knowledge assessment

So, I went over the five stages of an IT interview. You probably thought I exaggerated. No, though, in terms of soft skills, system design, live coding, Python testing, and recruiting. There will be a follow-up call to present the offer. Therefore, some form of Facebook spam is the second phase. Not only does it work with live coding while talking about the answer instead of just coding, but the questions on it are quite stupid, to put it bluntly. backward and outdated. So, in accordance with the company's rationale, you can send soaps there to save your gentlemen's time. I mean, I'm not Don Carleone, of course, but Middle can't see the wisdom of the master. Banally looks superficially in addition to not looking at all.

Take the problem of figuring out the program's runtime, for example. Well, "time." is challenging. I would have brought a better instrument, though. Nonetheless, the appropriate solution is to use 'time.monotonic'. Undoubtedly true, but will we really take measurements on the evening of June 30 to July 1, 2024? seems time that seems boring, really monotonous in every way? After enquiring more, I learned that while the other person is aware of the monotonous time, they have no understanding of the NTP or the transitional second.

In addition, the NAC interview gives me the chance to assess the quality of the individuals I will be working with. Then someone said, "I have a few questions for you." For some reason, I thought we were incompatible immediately.

## SRE/DevOps

Given that I had a lot of free time and was unemployed, I chose to interview with DevOps. Was it all for nothing—joking, snarky, still passed, but embarrassing to write about—the Linux course on Udemy? That's when I really started to like the process. The two processes in question were troubleshooting and general knowledge.

The interviewer mainly stuck to the list of questions, but he was also allowed to veer off topic from time to time, which enlivened the conversation. We've had time to discuss Linux loading, networking, databases, and functioning in containers. What is a universal phenomenon that exists in all forms throughout the universe? They might not have been so deeply, but a baccalaureate could have addressed them. In the end, the other person learned something new, and I gave them some resources to look into.

It was a troubleshooting role-playing game. Users report that even with a system in place, the website does not load. There are no notebooks or dashboards; instead, you have a sensible jungle that can be programmed to do or observe things. At least it was fun and as near to the real job as it gets. It's not a tough challenge, and it just took an hour. And in this instance, the scientific method is subordinated to actual observations. The system's condition at the time of the incident must be partially known to the SRE.

## Advice for prospective candidates

Over the last five years, I've conducted several hundred interviews with both sides. A few life tips are as follows:

You are going to have to go through the windshields. You won't go see these folks. Depending on how well you apply your skills, either something exciting arises out of the blue or it will be the only place with the offer. You never know what might be found within a candy box.

 -Get some sleep and rest on the day of wrath. The same live code is kind of dumb; the response will appear immediately even if it doesn't appear during the request.
Fill up a glass with water. When faced with any unclear situation, drinking is a reasonable and sufficient filler.
Talk to me. It's a good idea to talk about distracting topics with your coworker or cat prior to the conversation. It reduces anxiety to some extent.
Stay at ease. It may be more challenging, for sure, but after a year or two, you'll even say, "Thank you." This way of thinking will help to reduce the degree of stiffness to some extent.
Make sure to solicit feedback from others. Without feedback, learning is very challenging.


I would want to remind you that rejection requires a more forgiving attitude. Simply put, you weren't the best candidate for that position at this organization. It doesn't make you a bad person or coder. All I received were polite rejections, along with the statements, "We thought you would fall somewhere and agree to the penny against Quater," and that I was "overqualified." Perhaps there isn't a position available for me.

## Interviewers' suggestions

More empathy. Moreover, there's no reason for you to remove him; your role is to assess whether communication is comfortable between you both and whether he can fulfill the obligations entrusted to him. It is not possible to complete it in one and a half hours.

## Lack of conviction

 Most of them were start-ups or small enterprises with 20–30 employees. Consequently, a discernible distinction exists between their interviews and the ones conducted by the corporation. Recruiters receive a lot of resumes and job openings, so at first, bold decisions could appear possible. For example, following seven fruitful interviews, I received word that I could not be recruited. How absurd is that? But I can use their hiring for streaming as a justification. Everyone is being seriously taken advantage of by them, "and we're going to figure it out someday." Additionally, all of the procedures are fully standardized. Whether you're a senior Python student with fifteen years of referral experience or not, you go through every step of misery.
