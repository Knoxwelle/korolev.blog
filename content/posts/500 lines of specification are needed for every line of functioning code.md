Promising is a beautiful thing. Specifications are important in this sense because they set the foundation for building systems. Taking into account the behavior of individual components as well as the interconnections between them on a micro and macro scale is essential when analyzing the architecture as a whole.

Unfortunately, architects are often fascinated with design and gravitate toward architectural abstractions. However, the specs are meaningless on their own. The ultimate goal of the software project is to create a fully functional system. The architect should never lose sight of this goal or the fact that design is only a tool and not the finished product. The architect of the skyscraper would soon come to regret defying physics to achieve the elegant design of the edifice. Big issues will surface if the project's ultimate goal—a working code—becomes muddled.

If they identify problems with your design, it's probable that they are right and it's defective or at the very least unclear. Your first responsibility in these circumstances is to adjust the design to meet the practical requirements. Your team members may help you determine what works and what doesn't, so you can do this by consulting with them. None of the designs are perfect from the start; all are subject to change when implemented. 

When working on a project as a developer, you should learn to respect the time you spend writing the code and don't trust anyone who tells you that the design is the only thing that requires effort. You will have a considerably more realistic macro- and micro-level vision of the project after you try to breathe life into your invention.
