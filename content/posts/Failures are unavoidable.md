It increases the likelihood that the system will experience a malfunction at least once in any given period of time, but it also makes it possible to survive isolated hardware failures.

The software code is also vulnerable. We employ monitoring tools to keep track of application issues, but because they depend on software, these tools might sometimes break.

We try to automate our diagnoses, actions, and workflows since humans are fallible. Automation increases the likelihood of errors coming from rule noncompliance but decreases the likelihood of errors resulting from rule violations. More circumstances can be handled by a human than by any automated technology.

For this reason, we're including monitoring techniques in automated solutions. new software with fresh bugs. Networks are made up of hardware, software, and long communication lines. Networks may, therefore, malfunction. Even in cases where a network behaves as intended, its behavior is formally unpredictable since the state space of a large network is virtually infinite. 

Every security step we take to solve an issue makes it easier for mistakes to happen again. We configured clustering to allow the application to automatically alternate between a healthy and unhealthy server, but now there's a risk of "capacity splitting" in the event that issues with the cluster network arise.

Recall that the Trimayle Island 2 accident was mostly caused by the pressure discharge valve, a safety mechanism intended to prevent certain types of failures associated with high pressure.

Therefore, what should we do as system failures are inevitable?

One thing to remember is that various failures will always occur in your system. By rejecting the notion that these mistakes are unavoidable, you give up the ability to identify and manage them. But by accepting this fact, you may design a system that responds to specific mistakes. Just as auto designers use deformation zones to first deform areas and then dampen collision energy for passive passenger safety, you can develop failure prevention modes that will isolate damage and shelter the remaining system components.

If you don't, you'll be left to deal with all of the unanticipated, often dangerous, systemic failures.
