Another salary calculation project is currently failing horribly somewhere; it's probably not your fault.

Why did that happen? because Ruby was chosen by the developers instead of Smalltalk, Java, or Python? since you've decided to use Postgres instead of Oracle? or because, although you ought to have selected Linux, you liked the Windows platform better? As you are aware, project failures are often attributed to technology. 

Projects are typically started by people, and it is up to these people to determine whether the initiative succeeds or fails overall. And once that's the case, we should think about the ways we might help them succeed.

As a result, you think that one of the team members is performing poorly and preventing the project from moving forward. The very old and well-tried technology used to address these kinds of problems is the most significant technological advancement in human history. You need to communicate. 
But as a technology, communication strategies alone are insufficient. Having the ability to respect, believe in, and give credit to others are essential qualities that turn an intelligent leader into an effective one. 
The matter is not closed, of course, but there are a few simple rules you can follow to make your correspondence with subordinates far more effective: 

- See interactions aimed at fixing problems as constructive dialogues rather than adversarial situations.

- Start off with positive assumptions about other people, and use the conversation as a chance to ask interesting questions. By doing this, you can get more illuminating information and avoid making your interviewees defensive. 

- Don't start the conversation until you're in a mood that allows you to communicate. 

- If you are generally upset, angry, agitated, or unbalanced, your interlocutor is likely to interpret your nonverbal indications as an attack. 

- Seize opportunities, such as a chance for mutual benefit.

Rather than scolding the developer to shut up at meetings because he doesn't let anyone speak, ask him if he can let you participate in other people's talks. Tell him that it takes longer for introverts to converse and that it would be very helpful if he waited five seconds before speaking. 
If you have a common purpose, manage your emotions, and view the "problems" that your interlocutors bring as learning opportunities, you will become more efficient and learn something new every time.
