Since there isn't a single, all-encompassing solution for a broad variety of various challenges, the architect must constantly hone and enhance his "context noe poche." In "Systems Architecting: Creating & Building Complex Systems" (Prentice Hall, 1991), Eberhardt Rechtin writes:

Most likely, he would say, "I'm just using common sense." <...> It might be preferable to use the phrase "context sensation"1—knowledge of what is relevant in a certain context—instead of the word "sensual." Through education, experience, and case studies, the architect-practitioner can develop a strong contextual awareness by the time they are asked to tackle a system-level issue, which typically takes decades. 

I believe that one of the main issues facing the software business is that projects are frequently assigned to individuals who lack sufficient contextual awareness.This might be because the sector is only two generations old and is currently going through a period of rapid expansion; perhaps this issue's elimination indicates that the industry has reached a mature stage.

In my consulting practice, I frequently come across this issue in its various forms. Here are some typical illustrations: Rejecting domain-driven design1 when it makes sense; losing perspective and becoming overly excited about the design of a software solution for a task that isn't delayed; and making absurd or pointless suggestions when efforts to optimize the system's speed are at a standstill.

The key to understanding program templates is knowing when to use them and when not to.The same holds true for the theories regarding the underlying causes of the issue and the appropriate course of action. A universal solution "for all cases of life" does not, by definition, exist in either scenario when creating the system's architecture or when analyzing the problem; instead, the architect must hone his contextual sense, formulate architectural solutions, and recognize and eliminate any flaws in those solutions.
