I've been going to interviews again, and I'd like to share some observations. This time we talk about system design enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.

## System Design

In senior grades, another type of interview appears—system design. In one hour you have to design systems, thinking about the architecture of which in a real project you would spend several weeks. IDEF0, UseCase, ER, C4, DFD, BPMN—forget these scary words; there's no time for them. Figac-figac and Proudakshen. Requirements collection -> usage options -> system requirements -> processing -> presentation of the solution, time has passed. The main thing here is more basic words: to build a smart face and somewhere to put kafka. Then they'll be behind you in 40 minutes.
