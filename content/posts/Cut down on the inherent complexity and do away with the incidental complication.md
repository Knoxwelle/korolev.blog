For example, national air traffic coordination is a labor-intensive process. The control system needs to keep track of every aircraft's precise location at all times, including height, speed, direction, and destination, in order to prevent collisions both in the air and on the runways. In addition, under constantly shifting circumstances, it's imperative to quickly adjust aircraft schedules to avoid traffic bottlenecks at airports. A significant shift in the weather calls for a thorough reworking of the schedule. 

On the other hand, unintended complexity arises from issues that we feel need to be handled in order to reduce the inherent complexity. A simple illustration of complexity is the flight management system, which is still in use even though it is outdated. The system was developed to manage the challenging task of coordinating the flight of thousands of aircraft; yet, this approach is not without its problems. The complexity of today's flight control systems makes upgrades difficult, if not impossible. Today, flight management is utilized all around the world, thanks to over thirty years of technological improvement. 

A lot of infrastructures (frameworks) and business "solutions" suffer from "secondary complexity syndrome." Real gains come from infrastructures designed to solve specific, limited problems; overly complicated infrastructures, on the other hand, make matters worse.

Complex solutions tend to draw developers in the same way that fires draw moths, often with the same result. Since programming is fundamentally the solving of riddles, it is intriguing to tackle complex issues. Who hasn't been won over by the completion of an incredibly difficult task? But focusing on work that has inherent complexity makes it exceedingly hard to keep large-scale endeavors free of secondary complications. 

Infrastructures with a working code are better than those with ivory towers. Compare the amount of code intended to achieve the present goal with that which only serves to enable user interaction with the application. The solutions provided by the developers should be utilized with caution because, although initially appearing sound, they often contain extra complexity. Check to see if the response fits the assignment requirements. 

It is the responsibility of the architect to solve issues that are naturally difficult without adding unnecessary complications.
