When faced with alternatives, people tend to believe that the most important thing is to make the right choice.In design (software products or anything else) this is not the case.The presence of an alternative is a sign that uncertainty in the design of the system needs to be analysed. Use uncertainty as a determining factor to identify places where you can postpone the transition to details or apply breakdown and abstraction to reduce the importance of design decisions.If you strictly “sew” in the system the first decision that came to your mind, it is likely to tie your hands in the future.As a result, random decisions will begin to play an important role, and the flexibility of the software product will decrease.

One of the simplest and most constructive definitions of architecture was given by Grady Booch: "Any architecture is the result of design, but not every design is aimed at creating architecture.Architecture serves as a representation of the important design solutions that shape the system, and the importance here is determined by the cost of changes.”It follows that an architecture that generally reduces the importance of design decisions is effective.Inefficient architecture increases this importance.If a design solution can lead one of the two paths, the architect must step back.Instead of choosing between options A and B, he needs to think about another question: "How do I design a solution to reduce the importance of a choice between options "A" and "B"?In this situation, it is not the choice between A and B that is interesting, but the very fact that this choice exists (as well as the fact that the right choice is not necessarily obvious or unchanged). 

Sometimes an architect has to walk around before he is illuminated and recognises a dichotomy. Are you standing at the board, discussing (very energetically) different options with a colleague?Are you deliberately throwing "M-m-m" and "E-e-e" over the code, endlessly scrambling possible implementations?When a new requirement or clarification of an existing requirement calls into question the reasonableness of the current implementation, you face uncertainty.How do we react to it?Think of how to isolate a decision from the code that ultimately depends on that decision by means of separation or encapsulation.The alternative to this is often the vague code, which, like a nervous person at an interview, cries something unreasonable and tries to compensate for the uncertainty with a lot of guesses and common phrases. And if the choice is made with firm, but unfounded confidence, the project at full speed and without a glance turns into the wrong path.

Often there is a temptation to take a "decision for a decision".If there is uncertainty about the different paths to develop the system, decide not to make a decision. Postpone a particular decision until it can be taken more responsibly on the basis of real knowledge, but not for too long, so as not to get into a situation where that knowledge is already useless.

Architecture and the design process are closely intertwined; this is the main reason why the architect should give preference to such design cycles and architectural approaches that are empirical in nature and provide feedback in order to constructively use uncertainty to divide the system itself into parts and schedule its design.
