Functional requirements are where business application users' needs are mostly expressed. The architect is in charge of the system's non-functional elements, which include performance, flexibility, downtime, support requirements, etc. Simultaneously, initial testing of non-functional needs is sometimes completely assigned to the system maintenance team or delayed until a very late point in the development cycle.

This is a far more frequent error than it ought to be. It may be founded on a number of factors.It may seem futile to worry about the program's speed and adaptability when it isn't precisely fulfilling the necessary role yet. Both the test settings and the tests themselves are highly intricate. Due to low use intensity, early working versions of the system might not have been subjected to a realistic load.

But you lose a great deal of information about when performance changes happen when you push performance to the end of a project's life cycle. Performance testing ought to begin as soon as feasible if system architecture and design are to be evaluated based in part on performance.Performance testing, in my opinion, ought to be incorporated into the process by the third iteration if you choose a flexible development methodology with two-week iterations.

Why does it matter so much? To begin with, you will know what adjustments have caused the drastic drop in output.It is sufficient to concentrate on the aspects that have changed recently if the system is experiencing performance issues; an analysis of the full design is not necessary. The scope of modifications that require analysis is reduced by doing performance testing often and early on.

During early testing, you will at least obtain a set of fundamental indicators that you can use in your subsequent work, even if you choose not to attempt diagnosing performance. Subsequently, this data will be crucial in pinpointing and resolving the origin of performance issues.

This method also makes it possible to evaluate the choices made during the system architecture design and development process in light of real performance requirements.

It's common knowledge that planning technical testing is a difficult undertaking. It takes a lot of effort to configure the environment, create data sets, and provide the required test cases. By enabling the test environment to be developed gradually, early performance testing saves you a great deal of time and work when it comes to later performance problem detection.
