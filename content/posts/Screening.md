I've been going to interviews again, and I'd like to share some observations. This time we talk about Screening in enterprise companies, and how the recruitment process should be constructed.

## Screening

It all starts with it, and tech-screening becomes the norm. Recruiter directly on the first call asks cavernous questions and checks with sparkling. For example:

- how to stop the container?
- unchanged data typesx in python?
- What's the PID of the Linux kernel?
- how do you decipher CAP and PACELC?
- ...
 
Some of them go even further and create an entire platform with small pieces of code that can be run. 20 questions in 20 minutes. "How do I send a message to the generator?" or "What does this code do?" Well, he knows, I't just miss that code on a review, because it's wild. Well, yes, I forgot that sorted's second argument is only named, so we get a minus. And the system doesn't care what Google does in 25 seconds, I checked.

Will you have such a screening or not? I don't know, but be prepared. One such conversation caught me on the Skytrain, it was a little weird. But it seems to me that even recruiters are tired of the outcasts, who do not know anything, but send resumes to all available places.

But at the same time the magic of the calendar was mastered by ~20% of them. They are somehow convinced that by the phrase "I made a call on Friday at 1:30 pm, here's the link..." the communication is over. No, damn it! Calendar! Because I:

- I'll forget
- I'll lose links
- I'll take a timeslot
- I'll count for an hour and a half instead of an hour.
- I don't get to know the interlocutor off-the-shelf.
- and generally 1:30 pm it was UTC (not PST)

There should be a mandatory test when setting up a recruiter for work. And in one big company with circles came to the fact that in 2 weeks we agreed on the interview 3 times, but in the end the interviewer did not come, then the time did not set ("I put on Monday?" - "Oh, free all day" - and silence...). And if you ask to transfer because of illness, you will be forgotten at all. With the calendar of facaps will be less.
