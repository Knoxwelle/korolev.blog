When it comes to developing a software architecture, we first imagine the classic technical operations: system breakdown into modules, defining interfaces, allocating responsibilities, applying templates, and optimizing performance.In addition, the architect must take into account a number of other aspects, including safety, ease of use, easy maintenance, output management, choice of deployment settings, etc.However, all of these technical and procedural aspects must be relevant to the needs of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account in the analysis of requirements is a great way to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are complete.

All parties involved in the project have interests affecting both the software development process adopted in the organization and the organization as a whole. It is the analysis of these interests that forms the resulting set of priorities for the architect. It can be said that the creation of architecture is the process of balancing priorities in the short-term and long-term perspectives within the existing context.

Take, for example, the engineering department of a software development service provider.Most likely, this organization has certain priorities: compliance with contractual obligations, earning revenue,ining a good reputation among customers, reducing costs and creating valuable technical assets.These business priorities are transformed into the department’s priorities: to ensure the functionality, correctness and “quality attributes” of the product being developed, as well as the productivity of the development team, the sustainability of the design process, the ability to audit it, the adaptability and durability of software products.

The work of an architect is not simply to create a functional, high-quality software product for users, but to do so with respect to the interests of other parties – the management of the company (cost reduction), the staff serving the product (ease of administration), future members of the team of programmers (easy study and support), and taking into account the experience accumulated by the professional community of architects.

The architect can deliberately shift the balance in favour of one of the priorities for a short time, but in the long term, to get the work done really well, you should avoid any distortions.At the same time, the balancesined should correspond to the existing context, taking into account factors such as the projected lifecycle of the software product, the criticality of the product for the organization, and the technical and financial culture of the company.

In short, the creation of a software product architecture is not limited to technical aspects; it is also necessary to find the right balance between the technical requirements and the business requirements of all stakeholders.
