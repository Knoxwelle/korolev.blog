"Fast" cannot be a requirement. Not only does it have a quick reaction time, but it's also "expandable." The main reason is that there are no unbiased guidelines for carrying out these responsibilities.Nevertheless, users need these functionalities. The architect's duties include making sure the system possesses the necessary characteristics and resolving the inevitable conflicts that arise between them. In the absence of objective benchmarks, the architect is forced to rely on the developer's obsession with inane concepts (“No, the program is not ready; it isn't working fast enough”) and his or her own whims (“No, I can't accept the program; it doesn't work fast enough”).

Generally, we try to document all of these requests along with any other information. All too often, though, this section seems to be a list of vague words like "friendly to accompany," "flexible," and so on. However, any of these factors—including "ease of use"—may be numerically measured with enough work, allowing criteria to be set.If this isn't done, users won't have any objective reasons to embrace the system, developers won't have any useful recommendations to refer to when working, and the architects' original vision for the system will become less evident.

Ask simple questions like "how much?" What is the duration of this? How frequently? For what duration? ascends or descends? How quickly? If you are unable to respond, you cannot know what the customer requires. You'll need to give your selections serious thought if the system's economic model does not include the remedies. If you are working on system architecture, think about why the customer has not given you these figures. You will then be able to get them. The next time someone tells you this, ask them why the system needs to be scalable and from where the extra users are coming.Find out the number and time of it. It is not acceptable to accept the answers "many" and "almost."

Setting unclear quantitative requirements as a range with lowest, normative, and maximum values is the optimal approach. In the event that such an interval cannot be supplied, it is unclear what behavior the system must display. While you work on the design, you can test the system to make sure it still complies with these standards and confirm that it remains within permissible deviations. Changes in the manner in which particular criteria are fulfilled over time provide valuable insights. Determining these intervals and verifying system compliance costs money and effort. If no one is interested enough in the system's definition, features, or performance to pay for performance testing, then it's possible that this indicator means absolutely nothing. When creating an architecture, focus on the valuable characteristics of the system.

"The system must handle user input in less time than 1500 milliseconds. At a standard load (defined as...), the average reaction time should be between 750 and 1250 ms. Payment will not be issued if the response time is less than 500 ms because users do not perceive this as being that short. Still, this might be deemed essential.
