As technicians, we choose particular strategies, technologies, and approaches to solve problems not because they provide the greatest answer, but rather because we genuinely wish to incorporate them into our overview. Choosing such a course of action rarely pays off. 

Your grateful clients who are lining up to recommend you to others will be the most effective career catalyst because of how well you have served them. The gracious customers will provide you with greater service than any recently developed paradigm or in-vogue item in the new language. Architects need to stay up to date on evolving concepts and technologies, but you should never try to take on additional work at the client's expense. It is imperative for architects to always remember that their organization's success is their responsibility. As a result, you should steer clear of conflicts of interest, operate honorably and competently in your clients' best interests, and show that you are fully committed to your company. If the suggested project doesn't seem relevant or intriguing enough for your current career goals, find another one. 

What would happen if you were forced to participate in an impossible project like this one? It would benefit everyone—including you—if you chose technology with the client's needs as your top priority rather than your resume. There are times when it is difficult to resist the impulse to use a new, trendy remedy, even when it is ineffective for the issue at hand. 

When the right response is given, the customer and team are satisfied, and there is a noticeable decrease in the overall stress of project work. Your loved ones will notice and appreciate the difference in your condition when you get home from work. 

You can always prioritize the client's long-term needs over your own immediate ones. not go wrong.
