We, programmers, sometimes choose to use certain technologies, methodologies, and approaches to problem-solving not because they provide the optimal solution, but simply because deep down, we want to mention them in our resumes. Such a choice very rarely leads to a positive result.

The most powerful catalyst for any career will be grateful clients lining up in long queues to recommend you to others – after all, you worked so hard for them. If this is true, it's strange that they let you go. Client goodwill
It will serve you much better than any trendy object of a trendy language and any trendy paradigm. Although it is very important (and even vital) for a software architect to stay updated on the latest trends and technologies, never try to broaden your horizons at the expense of the client. Remember that as an architect, you are entrusted with the well-being of your organization; accordingly, you are expected to act honestly and competently in the interests of the client, avoiding any conflicts of interest and maintaining full loyalty to your organization. If the proposed project is not relevant or promising enough for your current career goals, find another project.

What else does the choice of a trendy language or technical solution in a project threaten? Will your client be able to find a programmer in the future who can maintain all this code? If it's Java or Python, then definitely, they will be able to find someone on the market who agrees to deal with someone else's spaghetti code! Maybe these languages aren't that interesting, but they just work. They just work! By the way, take a look at the salaries of COBOL programmers.

What if it's impossible to find another project (hello, Big4), and you still have to participate in such an event? Well, of course, the question arises whether you want to implement this trendy technology yourself or if you are acting on orders from above. If you work in consulting, utilization will be a priority for you. At the interview, you can even mention what an enthusiast you are - but don't exaggerate. Those clients who have already been burned by such dead-end solutions will not be pleased with you. Both for yourself and everyone else, it will be better if you choose the technology in the interest of the client, rather than for your own resume. Sometimes it is difficult to resist the temptation to apply a new trendy solution, even if it is poorly suited to the current situation.

With the right solution, you get a satisfied team and a pleased client, and the overall tension of working on the project noticeably decreases. Often, this allows you to delve deeper into a technology you are already familiar with or to explore a new one in your free time. Or maybe you'll even free up time for Work-Life Balance, which everyone keeps talking about. Your loved ones will appreciate it too – they will notice the difference in your state when you come home from work.

Perhaps your problem isn't even about technology! However, always prioritize the long-term needs of the client over your own short-term needs, and you won't go wrong.
