Many of us began our careers as architects in highly technical roles requiring proficiency with computer communication. Nonetheless, as architects, interpersonal communication is our main mode of exchange. Whether you are debating the merits of employing a template with developers or summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of buying intermediate software for management, your ability to communicate clearly is critical to your success. 

It is difficult to assess the architect's impact on the project objectively, but one thing is for sure: if the developers routinely disobey his instructions and the management does not value his advice, then the "correctness" of the architect's actions will not affect the course of his career. Professional architects are aware that they need to "promote" their ideas, and effective communication is essential to this.

Many books have been written about interpersonal communication, but I want to share with you one simple technique that can help you succeed as an architect by improving your communication abilities dramatically. When you have to defend your position in front of several people at once, take a stand. Whether you are in a formal system project study or just having a casual discussion between two charts, it doesn't matter. Get up, especially if everyone else is seated. 

When you speak up, people start to see you as a confident, authoritative person right away. You're beginning to demand interest. There's less likelihood of disruptions. Everything about this will have a significant impact on the conversation, whether or not your proposals are implemented. 

It should be noted that a standing person uses gestures and mimics more intensely. When addressing a group of ten or more people, standing up might help you make eye contact with everyone in the room. Optical contact, gestures, mimics, and other visual clues are important in communicating. Speaking while standing also affects your speech's volume, tempo, and pitch. When you start speaking in front of a large group of people, you take a moment to highlight important themes. The effectiveness of communication is considerably increased by each of these elements. 

Would you prefer to express your opinions once more rather than twice? It's really easy: just get up.
