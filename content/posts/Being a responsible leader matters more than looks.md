Upon being drawn to the project, the architect's urge to "show himself" is evident.The hiring of a software architect typically signifies the organization's trust in the expert's technical proficiency; thus, the architect aspires to promptly demonstrate his merit for the trust. Unfortunately, there are those among us who mistakenly think that in order to "imagine yourself in all its glory," one must shock, if not completely obscure, the group with their technical brilliance.

While making an impact on the audience is crucial for marketing, it has a detrimental effect on program project management. By taking a responsible leadership stance and having a solid grasp of both the technical and substantive aspects of the challenge at hand, the architect can gain the respect of his team.

An architect should play a worthy role in responsible leadership. 

A software architect's work is typically focused on satisfying user needs, with input from experts in the field to help guide the way.A compromise between the time and workforce available to complete the project and the cost and complexity of execution results in a successful design.

The architect's time and money are firm resources, and he or she must manage them honestly and without any deceptive tactics to further personal agendas. It is rare for highly complicated systems built on contemporary infrastructure or technologies to be completed without incurring additional costs for the business. Similar to an investment broker, an architect is entrusted with his clients' money, and it is expected that his work will yield a respectable return on investment.

Never forget that you are handling other people's money; handling responsibly is more vital than making a good impression.
