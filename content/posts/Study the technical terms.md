There is jargon in every profession, which makes communication between its representatives more successful. Software architects converse about ROA, two-stage presentation, and supertypes of levels; lawyers converse about Habeas Corpus, Voir Dire, and Venire; carpenters converse about connections, infiltration, and impregnation. A moment, please excuse me.

Having efficient channels of communication amongst software architects is crucial, irrespective of the platform they operate on. Architectural and design templates are among these tools. Understanding fundamental architectural patterns and design templates, being able to recognize them in code, knowing when to apply them, and being able to use them in discussions with other architects and developers are all necessary for working as an architect.

Enterprise-level templates, application-level templates, integration templates, and design templates are the four primary categories into which architectural and design templates fall. The overall architecture's pattern's degree of abstraction typically serves as the definition for these categories.Whereas design templates deal with the behavior and structure of certain parts of the overall architecture, corporate-level templates are related to high-level architecture.

The structure of high-level architecture is defined by corporate-level patterns.Event-driven architecture (EDA), service-oriented architecture (SOA), resource-oriented architecture, and pipeline architecture are the most popular architectural patterns. 

Application-level templates provide information on how a subsystem or application is designed within the framework of a wider corporate architecture. This category contains templates from Martin Fowler's "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" (Addison-Wesley Professional) as well as well-known J2EE templates (such as Session Facade and Transfer Object).

When designing and explaining ideas about how parts, programs, and subsystems communicate data and functionality, integration templates are crucial. Examples of integration templates include the following: Multiple message patterns, file sharing, and calls to distant procedures.

Every architect should be familiar with the fundamental patterns found in the "Band Four" book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (Addison-Wesley Professional). Upon initial observation, these templates might appear excessively modest for an architect of a software product, yet they are a component of the lexicon that facilitates efficient communication between architects and developers.

The architect also needs to be aware of and comprehend the fundamentals of various antipatterns. Andrew Koenig coined the word "antipattern," which refers to recurrent behaviors that produce unsatisfactory outcomes. The following are well-known instances of antipatterns: Death March, Design by Committee, Analysis Paralysis, and Mushroom Management. Being aware of these patterns will assist you in avoiding a lot of common errors.

Clear, succinct, and effective communication is a must for software architects to have with one another. We architects merely need to study and comprehend patterns to benefit from them.
