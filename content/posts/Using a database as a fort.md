The database contains all of the information, both that entered by employees and that obtained from clients. Changes in user interfaces, business logic, applied logic, and even staff don't affect the data. It is imperative that a reliable data model be created as early in the project as possible.

Prewriting complex, comprehensive technical requirements is a thing of the past! The new school demands that products be delivered frequently and early.Writing one line of vulnerable code is better than writing 10 in your head. When it comes to the facts, at least, it looks too good to be true.

Data structures and their relationships usually do not change quickly, although user interfaces and business logic do. Because of this, it's imperative to define the data model precisely from the start, both analytically and structurally. Data migration "on-site" between circuits is, at best, difficult, always time-consuming, and often fraught with error. If database problems are allowed to continue for an extended period of time, it might lead to devastating consequences. Even when a problem with the data-level design has been found and fixed, the corrupted data cannot be recovered.

A reliable data model is one that can be extended to incorporate future data while maintaining the security of current data. Setting subject area limits wherever they exist, protecting reference data integrity, selecting the appropriate keys to support reference integrity and compliance, and ensuring vulnerability to errors that, despite your best efforts, penetrate the ever-evolving application level are all part of ensuring security. Proper normalization of the data is necessary to provide scalability. Only then would it be possible to add new architectural layers to the data model without having to take several shortcuts and workarounds.

The database is your most crucial data's last line of defense. The applied level cannot monitor itself because it is transitory. For the database to provide the necessary protection, the data model must be constructed to reject irrelevant data and prevent the creation of nonsensical relationships. The system has concise, easy-to-verify, self-documenting explanations of the keys, external key links, and topic area constraints. Furthermore, the data model's subject area rules are long-term and physical; changes to the application's logic do not nullify them.

To get the most out of a relational database and turn it into a comprehensive component of your application rather than just a place to store application data, you have to know exactly what you are doing from the start. The quality of the data will improve as your product improves, but it must remain a fortress during the whole development phase. After that, you may put your confidence in him and assign him the task of intercepting errors from higher application levels with assurance that he won't fail you down.
