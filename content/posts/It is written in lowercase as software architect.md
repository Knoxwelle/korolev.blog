There has been a depressing tendency in the field of software development lately: the aim to elevate software design to a professional standing comparable to that of the traditional school of architecture. Architects seem to want to validate their accomplishments in the eyes of the general public instead of their immediate employers and network of peers. However, it wasn't until the end of the 19th century—a millennium after its inception—that architecture achieved professional stature. Some software architects rush their attempts to gain attention.

 However, software development is still in its infancy. This industry still lacks enough knowledge for us to credibly classify it as professional. The software development sector is relatively new, but despite this, its products are highly appreciated, and qualified experts in the field—as well as those who aspire to appear—are compensated at a level commensurate with top professional disciplines like law, accounting, and medicine.

Software development apprentices receive competitive compensation for their imaginative and research-based work. Our labors have produced numerous noteworthy outcomes, some of which have been beneficial to all of humanity. Our true merits and abilities stand in the way of recognition; in fields that have advanced to a professional level, there are internships and training programs that are noticeably better than those offered by our industry peers. Examine the situation and determine how justified we are in the status quo, and consider how audacious it would be to demand that a software architect be treated on the same footing as a lawyer, physician, and dentist.

Recognize and agree that the position of "software architect" requires the strict letter "a" to be written.
