There are several reasons why a software project might not succeed. One of the most common reasons projects fail is modifying the work schedule in the middle of the project without adequate planning. These kinds of failures can be avoided, but it will require a large team effort to do so. Changes to a project's schedule or resource allocation usually don't result in any problems. Problems occur when you have to work longer hours in the same amount of time or shorten the schedule without reducing the task.

The myth that you may shorten the schedule to save costs or speed product delivery is one that is widely held. More hours are typically put in, or "less important tasks" (such as modular testing) are abandoned in order to produce a product faster or with better functionality that doesn't delay delivery. At all costs, steer clear of the circumstance. Remind those who depend on you to perform these tasks of the following details:

Slashing design times short raises the risk of poor documentation, problems with quality control, and system rejection by users. It degrades design quality as well.

- The decrease in coding or delivery times is directly connected to the quantity of errors in the final output.

- There is a strong correlation between the number of test problems and test time reduction, which leads to poorly tested code. 

- All of this suggests operational problems, and fixing these problems is much more expensive.

- In the end, expenditure both increases and stays the same. Usually, this is what leads to failure.

One day, as an architect, you will encounter a scenario where the sooner you take action, the better your chances of success. Please provide your ideas as soon as you can. First, try to stick to the schedule in order to preserve quality. If it is not possible to reduce the visuals, think about postponing non-essential aspects until subsequent versions. This will, of course, call for good negotiating skills, sound training, and the ability to persuade oneself that one is right. Now is the time to practice these topics. I guarantee you won't regret it.
