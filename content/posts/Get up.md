For many of us, an architect's career began with some sort of purely technical position, where success was largely determined by the ability to communicate with computers.But as an architect, we have to communicate mainly with other people. Whether you are discussing the advantages of a template with developers or explaining to management the pros and cons of buying intermediate software, your communication skills are the key to success.  

Objectively measure the degree of influence of the architect on the project is quite difficult, but one thing is quite clear: if the developers constantly ignore the instructions of the Architect, and the management does not attach importance to his recommendations, the "correctness" of the actions of architect will not affect the development of his career.Experienced architects understand that they have to "promote" their ideas, and this task requires the ability to communicate effectively.

Many books have been written on the subject of interpersonal communication, but I would like to offer you one simple and practical technique that will radically increase the effectiveness of your communication and consequently strengthen your success as an architect.In any situation you have to explain your position to several listeners at once, get up.It doesn’t matter where you are – at a formal system project analysis or an informal discussion of a pair of charts. Get up – especially if everyone else is sitting.  

When you get up, others automatically begin to perceive you as an authoritative and self-confident person. You're becoming the center of attention.You're less likely to be interrupted.All of this will have a significant impact on the discussion, whether your recommendations are accepted or not.  

It should also be noted that a standing person uses gestures and mimics more intensively. If you are communicating with a group of 10 or more people, standing up will help to establish visual contact with the entire audience. Optical contact, gestures, mimics and other visual elements play an important role in communication. In addition, the standing position changes the tone and volume of the voice, as well as the speaking pace: you start speaking so that you are heard in a large room, making pauses to highlight important moments. All these elements make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of communication.  
  
Do you want to increase the efficiency of communicating your ideas more than twice? It is very simple: get up.
