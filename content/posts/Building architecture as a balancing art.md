When designing a software architecture, the conventional technical procedures that spring to mind are disassembling the system into its constituent pieces, specifying interfaces, allocating responsibilities, employing templates, and optimizing performance. A wide range of other variables, including output management, deployment settings, convenience of use, safety, and maintenance, must also be taken into account by the architect.Meanwhile, every one of these technical and procedural specifics must be relevant to the requirements of the stakeholders.Taking these interests into account during the requirements analysis process is one of the greatest ways to ensure that the requirements specifications for the product being developed are thorough.

Every project participant has interests that affect both the company's software development process and the firm as a whole. Taking these interests into account leads to the architect's final list of priorities. It might be argued that within the constraints of the given framework, the process of building architecture entails balancing short- and long-term viewpoint priorities.

Think about the engineering department of a business that provides services for software development. This company's top priorities include probably producing money, keeping a good reputation with clients, decreasing costs, and creating valuable technical assets in addition to paying its obligations on time. The department's top priorities are these business priorities, which include ensuring that the product is developed with functionality, accuracy, and "quality attributes," as well as the productivity of the development team, the sustainability of the design process, its auditability, and the adaptability and durability of the software products.

Creating excellent software for users is only one aspect of an architect's job description; they also have to take into account the interests of other stakeholders, including the management of the company (cost reduction), the product's staff (ease of administration), potential programmers (easy study and support), and the professional community of architects.

The architect can deliberately tip the scales in favor of one of the priorities for a short while, but if you want the job done extraordinarily well in the long run, distortions should be avoided.In addition, the balances must take into account the current situation, which includes factors like the software product's expected lifetime, its significance to the company, and its technical and financial culture.

In summary, the process of developing a software product architecture encompasses more than simply the technical aspects; it also entails finding the right balance between the technology requirements and the business requirements of all stakeholders.
