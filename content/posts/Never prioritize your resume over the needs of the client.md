As technicians, we select specific technologies, tactics, and methods to address issues not because they offer the best solution but rather because we sincerely want to include them in our synopsis. Making such a decision almost never has favorable outcomes. 

Because you have done so successfully for them, your grateful clients who are waiting in line to refer you to others will be the most potent career catalyst. You will get better service from the kind clients than from any newly created paradigm or trendy object in the new language. Even though staying current with emerging ideas and technology is crucial for architects, you should never try to take on more work at the client's expense. As architects, you should never forget that you are responsible for the success of your organization. As such, you should avoid conflicts of interest, act competently and with integrity in the best interests of your clients, and demonstrate your undivided commitment to your business. Find a different project if the suggested one isn't pertinent or exciting enough for your present professional objectives. 

What happens if you are compelled to take part in a project like this even though it isn't feasible? If you prioritize the needs of the client over your CV when choosing technology, it will be beneficial for everyone—including you. Even when a new, trendy solution doesn't work for the problem at hand, there are instances when it is hard to resist the urge to use it. 

The appropriate answer results in a happy client and team as well as a discernible reduction in the overall stress of project work. When you get home from work, your loved ones will notice the difference in your condition and will appreciate it too. 

Always put the long term needs of the client above your own short needs and you can’t go wrong.
