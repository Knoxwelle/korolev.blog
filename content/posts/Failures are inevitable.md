It makes it possible to withstand isolated hardware failures, but it also makes it more likely that the system will malfunction at least once at any given time.

Additionally susceptible is the software code. We use monitoring tools to record application problems; but, as these tools rely on software code, they are likewise susceptible to malfunction.

Because humans make mistakes, we attempt to automate our workflows, diagnoses, and actions.Automation lowers the probability of errors resulting from rule violations but raises the probability of errors originating from rule noncompliance.A human being can react to a wider variety of situations than any automated technology.

We're including monitoring methods in automation tools because of this. Fresh flaws in new software. Hardware, software, and lengthy communication links make up networks. Thus, networks can potentially malfunction. Because a huge network's state space is essentially unlimited, a network's behavior is formally unpredictable even when it operates as intended. 

Every security measure we take to address a problem creates new opportunities for failures.We set up clustering so that the program automatically switches between a functioning and a failing server, but now there's a chance of "capacity splitting" when cluster network whims occur1.

It is important to remember that the pressure discharge valve, a safety feature designed to stop specific kinds of failures linked to excessive pressure, was mostly to blame for the Trimayle Island2 accident.

Consequently, since system failures are unavoidable, what should we do?

One thing to keep in mind is that your system will always experience a variety of failures.You lose the power to isolate and control these errors by refusing to accept that they are inevitable.However, by acknowledging this reality, you can create a system that reacts to particular errors.You can build failure protection modes that will isolate damage and shield the remaining system components, much like auto designers do with deformation zones—deforming areas first and squelching collision energy for passive passenger safety.

If you don't, you'll be stuck handling all of the unforeseen—and typically hazardous—failures that occur throughout the system.
