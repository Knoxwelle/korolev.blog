A software project can fail for many reasons.One of the most common sources of project failure is changing the schedule of work during the project execution without proper planning.Such failures can be avoided, but it requires considerable effort on the part of many people.Adjusting the timescale or adding resources to a project usually does not create any problems.Problems start when you are required to do more work in the same timeframe or shorten the schedule without reducing the load.

The idea that by shortening the schedule you can reduce costs or speed up the delivery of a product is a very common misconception.Typically, overtime is used or "less important tasks" (such as modular testing) are sacrificed for faster delivery of the product or for enhanced functionality without changing the delivery time.Avoid such a scenario at all costs.Remind those who require such measures of you of the following facts:

- Reducing design times leads to poor design quality and poor documentation, and also increases the likelihood of quality control problems and the risk that the system will not be accepted by the user.

- The reduction in coding or delivery times is directly related to the number of errors in the final product.

- Reducing test times leads to poorly tested code and is directly related to the number of tests problems. 

 - All of this entails problems at the stage of operation, and the elimination of such problems is much more expensive.

In the end, expenditure not only does not decrease, but increases.Usually this is the reason for failure.

As an architect, sooner or later you will find yourself in a situation where your chances of success are determined by how fast you act.Express your opinion as soon as possible.First try to ensure quality by keeping the scheduled schedule.If you can't do without shrinking the graphics, try to move non-critical functionality to future versions.Of course, this will require good training, negotiation skills and the ability to persuade themselves to be right.Start refining your skills in these areas today.Believe me, you won't regret it.
