Numerous factors can cause a software project to fail. Changing the work schedule mid-project without enough planning is one of the most frequent causes of project failure. These kinds of failures are preventable, but it will take a lot of work from many individuals. Adding resources or modifying the timeline to a project typically doesn't cause any issues. When you have to work more in the same amount of time or reduce the timetable without lowering the workload, problems arise.

A very prevalent fallacy is that you can cut expenses or expedite product delivery by shortening the timeline. Usually, extra hours are worked or "less important tasks" (such modular testing) are given up for quicker product delivery or for better functionality without affecting delivery time.Steer out of the situation at all costs. Remind others who need you to take such actions of the following information:

Cutting design periods short increases the possibility of quality control issues, inadequate documentation, and user rejection of the system. It also lowers design quality.

The number of errors in the finished product is directly correlated with the reduction in coding or delivery times.

Test problem count is closely correlated with test time reduction, which results in code that has not been well tested. 

All of this implies operational issues, and resolving these issues comes at a far higher cost.

Ultimately, spending not only stays the same but goes up. This is typically the cause of failure.

As an architect, you will eventually come across a situation where your odds of success are based on how quickly you act. Give your thoughts as soon as you can. First, make an effort to maintain quality by adhering to the timetable. If reducing the graphics is unavoidable, consider delaying non-essential features until later iterations. Naturally, this will need for strong bargaining abilities, solid training, and the capacity to convince oneself that one is correct. Put some practice into these areas right now. You won't regret it, I promise.
