The collection no longer serves as the project's "Big Bang" in terms of design. In every project, architects should promote the use of continuous integration techniques and technologies, both at the corporate and application levels.

Martin Fowler originally suggested the term continuous integration (CI) as a design template. It refers to a collection of techniques and equipment that guarantees consistent, automated application testing and assembly across brief intervals of time (sometimes on an integration server specifically created to carry out these tasks). Continuous integration, which combines automated assembly tools with modular testing techniques and tools, is now required for all modern software projects.

The project's components are now assembled and put to the test. These days, continuous integration has taken the position of "early and frequent assembly." It still involves assembly, but it now contains additional features that enhance communication and teamwork among developers.

Assembly is the most well-known aspect of continuous integration, and it is typically done automatically.While you can still build by hand, you can also set up a build job to run automatically each night or whenever you make changes to the source code. The most recent version of the source code is pulled from the repository at the beginning of the compilation process, and the continuous integration tool attempts to compile and test the project.Notifications outlining the outcomes mark the conclusion of the procedure. There are several ways to receive notifications, such as through email or instant messaging apps.

The process of development becomes more concentrated and stable with continuous integration. As an architect, this will appeal to you, but more significantly, continuous integration will improve the productivity of both your development teams and your organization as a whole.
