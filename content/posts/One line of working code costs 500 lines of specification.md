It is lovely to promethize. In this regard, specifications are crucial since they establish the framework for system construction. It is crucial to consider the architecture as a whole, taking into account the behavior of individual components as well as the interactions between them on a micro and macro scale.

Regrettably, architects are frequently enthralled with the design process and are drawn to architectural abstractions. But the specs are worthless in and of themselves. A truly functional system is the software project's ultimate goal. This objective should constantly remain in the architect's mind, and they should never forget that design is merely a tool, not the final product. The skyscraper's architect would soon come to regret disobeying the rules of physics in favor of the building's elegance. If the project's ultimate objective—a functioning code—becomes obscured, major problems will arise.

It's possible that they are correct and your design is flawed or at the very least ambiguous if they find issues with it. In these situations, your immediate duty is to bring the design into compliance with the practical needs. You can accomplish this by consulting with your team members, who can assist you in identifying what works and what doesn't. Every design is subject to modification when it is put into practice; none are flawless from the beginning. 

If you work as a developer on a project, you should learn to value the time you spend writing the code and don't believe people who tell you that creating the architecture is all that takes time. After you attempt to give your creation life, you will have a far more realistic macro- and micro-level vision of the project.
