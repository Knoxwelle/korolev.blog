The tools that architects use to design computer systems have undergone significant changes as a result of the technology's natural progression. These modifications have rekindled interest in multilingual programming, or using more than one language at the center of a software system's implementation.

The idea of multilingual programming is not new; one common example from the past is systems where the server portion is based on C++ COM objects while the client portion is written in Visual Basic.As a matter of fact, this architecture made good use of the advantages that each of the languages listed had at the height of their popularity.What modifications have sparked a renewed interest in bilingual programming? The genuine usage of text protocols has been made possible by new technical standards and a continual growth in resources, such as processing capacity and channel bandwidth. The days when clever binary protocols were the only way to create distributed systems that worked are long gone. XML/SOAP-based web services gave rise to remote text-level interaction, which is still developing toward REST architectural styles and other auxiliary (but equally significant) protocols like Atom and XMPP.

Because important information is now formatted text that can be generated and processed with universal means, we have more options than ever before for heterogeneous development with this new generation of technology.The ability of systems to interact at the text level solves many of the prior challenges, and heterogeneous design lets you select the best tool for each specific activity.

Architects may now use a combination of strong, specialized tools to talk about applying the right paradigm rather than just knowing how to use the right terminology. Different paradigms are supported by programming languages; object-oriented paradigms are supported, but so are functional and parallel programming paradigms. Some of these paradigms would be ideal for particular tasks or subject areas, while others wouldn't be appropriate. However, these unusual (and seemingly disparate) instruments can now be coupled much more easily than in the past to create sophisticated hybrid solutions.

The result of these modifications is already apparent in the combinatorial rise in architectural topological complexity of contemporary software systems. This feature is more of an indication of fresh opportunities than it is of their innate diversity.

Though it's not always beneficial, in the context of contemporary software architectures, choice is the "lesser evil" in this instance. We need to take advantage of any and all engagement opportunities because our industry is experiencing very serious challenges. This is especially true if the platforms that are now in use are not well equipped to solve these difficulties.

These days, the strain of new possibilities has caused the boundaries of technology to break, making the work of an architect even more challenging. Take on this challenge, develop a broad perspective, and use the abundance of options to your advantageâ€”heterogeneity triumphs.
