I've been going to interviews again, and I'd like to share some observations. This time it is about testing knowledge in enterprise companies and how the recruitment process should be constructed.

## Knowledge test

So, I talked about five stages of IT interviews. You probably thought I exaggerated. But no: recruiter, Python test, live coding, system design, soft skills. Then another call for the offer presentation. So, the second stage is just some kind of Facebook spam. Not only can it be combined with live coding if it is not just to code but to discuss the solution, but also the questions on it, softly speaking, are stupid. Primitive and old-fashioned. So, according to the company's logic, you can send soaps there, so you don't waste your gentlemen's time. I'm not, of course, Don Carleone, but Middle just can't appreciate the master's knowledge. Banally, he doesn't look there, but most importantly, superficially.

For example, the question of how to measure the running time of the program. Well, 'time.time' is complicated. Although I would have taken some more suitable tool. But the correct answer is to use 'time.monotonic'. No questionsâ€”it's absolutely true, but will we really measure in the night of 30 June to 1 July 2024? And is monotonous time really monotone evenly? After clarifying questions, I realized that the interlocutor is aware of the monotonous time but has absolutely no idea about the NTP and the transitional second.

And again, the NAC interview means that I can also know the level of who I'm going to have to work with. One of them said, "Here I'm asking questions." For some reason, I immediately thought we didn't work.
