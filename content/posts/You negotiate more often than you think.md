We have all fallen into “budget” refinements, when smart technological solutions are “buried” for savings.The conversation goes like this:

“Do we really need X?” the project sponsor asks.

In place of X you can replace virtually everything vital to the system: software licenses, surplus servers, external backups or power sources. The question is always asked in a native tone, as if you are dropping all your pocket money on comics and chewing, while serious adults need to think about buying new shells, in which they will drag their future profits.

The correct answer to this question is, "Yes. Absolutely necessary." But for some reason, almost no one answers.

After all, we have technical education, and any technical discipline is the art of compromise.It is clear that no one will need exotic power sources if you put several white wheels in the data center and start interns in them.And instead of saying, "Yes, absolutely necessary," we say something true: "You can actually do without a second server, if you're willing to play with the gaps because of prevention and with each memory failure.Although if we buy a memory with automatic regularity control, then this problem can be bypassed.So there are only failures of the operating system on average every 3.9 days, which means that at night the server will have to restart, but it is quite able to do the trainees when tired of turning the wheels”. 

And all this may be quite right, but you should not say that in any case. The sponsor stops listening to you after the words “really”. 

The problem is that you look at it from a technical point of view, and your sponsor clearly understands that he is negotiating. You're working together to find a solution, while he's conducting a "go out/do not go out" tactical manoeuvre. And in any negotiation, you should never make concessions on the first requirement. The correct answer to the question "Do we really need X?" is like this:

“Without a second server, the entire system will “fall” about three times a day, especially during periods of maximum load and when demonstrated at board meetings. In fact, we need four servers to ensure that one independent pairins 100% performance, even if the other pair suddenly stops working.”

Of course, you know perfectly well that the third and fourth servers are not really needed. This is a tactical gambit that will force your sponsor to switch the conversation to a different topic. You raise the bet and show that the system is still working on a minimal, risky configuration. Besides, if you miraculously manage to get additional servers, you can always pass one for testing (so that the testing environment is fully compatible with the working environment), and the other will be a great assembly machine.
