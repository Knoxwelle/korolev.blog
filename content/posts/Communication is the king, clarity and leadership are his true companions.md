All too frequently, software architects reside in ivory towers, dictating technologies and instructions to developers while leaving them with little to no guidance. Simultaneously, this causes conflict, which is soon followed by a "popular uprising." The end product is a piece of software that bears no relation to the original specifications. It is imperative for any software architect to be able to articulate to his peers the aims and purposes of the software project. Effective communication relies on leadership and clarity.

A communication procedure that is clear and concise. A one hundred-page document explaining your architectural choices will not be read by anyone in your group. Effective communication of ideas is essential for any program or effort to succeed. When starting work on the project, stick to brief explanations and don't start writing lengthy word descriptions. To make straightforward charts that clarify your thoughts, use software such as Visio. Diagrams must be straightforward since they will alter virtually constantly. Informal gatherings are yet another efficient way to share knowledge. Getting developers or other architects together in a room and putting your ideas on the board is the most effective technique to share your ideas with the project participants. A digital camera is a must (there's nothing more frustrating than having to exit the conference room after you've finished designing). Take a photo following the meeting, enlarge it, and share it with the other attendees via wiki. Put off creating large documents and concentrate on discussing your concepts with colleagues. Later, you can come up with a more thorough presentation of your architectural solutions.

A lot of software architects are unaware that they need to be leaders as well. You, as a leader, need to get the respect of your team members in order to work in a positive and productive environment. It is a surefire way to end up in a disastrous situation if developers don't know what the big picture looks like and why certain decisions are taken. Instead, by enlisting developers in your cause, you establish a collaborative workspace where the accuracy of your architectural choices is verified. Including designers in the process of creating architecture guarantees their interest and dedication.

Remember that effective communication with all team members—including the testing team, business analysts, and project managers—requires leadership and clarity. Strong and healthy work environments are produced by effective leadership and clear communication, which both improve communication quality.

If it is true that "communication is king," then leadership and clarity are its true friends.
