Clients and end users frequently insist on what they perceive to be a workable solution to an issue. Leading F-16 Falcon designer Harry Hillaker provides a prime illustration of this. His team's mission was to construct an airplane that could reach M2-2.5 speeds. This was (and probably still is) a tremendously difficult undertaking, especially if the secondary goal was to build a light aircraft that was "cheap." 

The Air Force clients told the design team that they required the M2â€“2.5 speed so that the aircraft could escape combat if necessary. The primary issue was resolved, and a feasible solution was presented by the designers when the true necessity became evident. This was in the form of a mobile aircraft with strong traction that offered good acceleration and maneuverability rather than a high top speed.

It holds true for software development as well. After understanding the true significance of the sought feature or requirement from the client, the architect should be able to get to the heart of the issue and, with any luck, present a more sensible and high-quality solution than the one the client is demanding. Prioritizing requirements becomes easier when there is a greater focus on their essential elements; the customer's most critical requirements take precedence.

How ought we to behave? The agile development manifesto has a principle that, in many situations, is particularly applicable: "Cooperation is more important than contract." Practically speaking, this entails arranging conferences and workshops where architects assess the demands of the client, assisting them in providing a "Why?" response. Remember that demand analysis frequently incorporates implicit assumptions and implied information, so coming up with a response to this issue can be very challenging. At these kinds of meetings, it is best to steer clear of technical solution discussions as they shift the focus from the client's problem to programming.
