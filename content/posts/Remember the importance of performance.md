Your car is 98% recyclable, roomy, comfy, economical, and affordable. Would you like one? Naturally. anybody desires.  Yes, the fact that it can only go a maximum of 10 km/h is the only issue. Did you not make up your mind? This brief illustration makes it quite evident that production is just as significant as any other factor.

Because computers process data at a rate that is unmatched by humans, many architects prioritize performance last because they believe the system's speed will be sufficient. Furthermore, Moore's law will ensure everything is taken care of if current systems are not quick enough.But the equipment's speed is simply one component of the system.

Some people define performance as only how long it takes a system to react to input from them. However, system architects must consider a number of performance factors, such as the speed of non-interactive components, the effectiveness of user-to-system communication, and the productivity of programmers and design analysts.

Productivity is a term used to describe the output of system builders.Due to its direct impact on the project's budget and schedule, this indication is crucial.If a team produces projects that are overbudget and have lengthy delays, they will inevitably have uncomfortable meetings with management. The speed at which the system is developed and begins to turn a profit can be significantly impacted by the selection of prefabricated components and appropriate tools. 

Users' adoption of the technology is largely determined by how well user interaction performs. This performance element is influenced by numerous aspects of the system architecture.Response time is the most obvious example, but it's by no means the only one.Performance is directly impacted by both the user's intuitive comprehension of the interface and the quantity of actions required to accomplish the goal.

A well-crafted system specification establishes the task's duration rather than just the response time. It is defined as the total length of time, including all user interactions with the system, needed to complete a task in a certain subject area. This feature also contains the operator's reflection and input times; these are non-system-controlled metrics in addition to response times. On the other hand, adding these metrics improves the user interface's quality. You can finally increase the productivity of the human operator by paying attention to the information supplied and the amount of operations needed to complete the task.

For the system to succeed, non-interactive component performance is just as crucial. For instance, the system stops working if the nightly package tasks take longer than twenty-four hours to complete. Another important consideration is how well emergency recovery components function. If a system component fails entirely, how long will it take to get the system back up and running again?

Performance should always be the primary consideration for architects and designers when examining the consolidated system's implementation and mode of operation.
