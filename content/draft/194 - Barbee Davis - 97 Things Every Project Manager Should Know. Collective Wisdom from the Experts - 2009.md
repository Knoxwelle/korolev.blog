Good working relati onships with stakeholders who have significant 
influence on the outcomes of a project are vital. Stakeholders are individuals 
and groups, both inside and outside the organization, who can influence the 
success of the project, and/or anyone who can be affected by the project.
Project managers should have a stakeholder engagement plan that includes 
identification of stakeholders, an assessment of their degree of influence, and 
an assessment of their favorability toward the project. Use this plan to deliberately build support.
Engage stockholders early and keep them involved through project completion. Be sure you know the business need for the project they support. Work 
toward aligning the needs of all of the key stakeholders, not just the top few.
It’s always pertinent to find out what the key stakeholders need to become visible and vocal advocates for the project, and how the project can be made to be 
a win for them, as well as for your team.
Once your project plan reflects the needs of the key stakeholders, insist that 
they demonstrate their commitment by providing the resources needed to 
support the project. This gives you an army of investors to fight outside stakeholders with no money or services who may want to stop the project.
It is advisable to assign a single point of accountability on the project team 
for coordinating stakeholder management, and to interface with and actively 
engage key stakeholders at appropriate levels. Create and utilize a stakeholder 
communication plan to capture frequency of communications, content of 
communication, and type of delivery method. Methods and frequency of contact may differ for each stakeholder.
Schedule an alignment meeting with smaller stakeholders to minimize conflicts between departments. Your stakeholder handler will follow up to ensure

that critical functions/groups are represented on the core project team, or on 
the extended project team, as resources.
Review stakeholder standards of success with decision makers at each meeting 
to ensure that alignment remains consistent.
Here are some other suggestions:
•	 Respect the business needs of stakeholders, even if you don’t agree.
•	 Ensure confidentiality on sensitive issues to build trust.
•	 Create an alliance of stakeholders to support your project.
•	 Get stakeholders actively and meaningfully involved.
•	 Solicit stakeholder ideas and use their input.
•	 Keep stakeholders informed.
•	 Leverage those with positive attitudes and get them invested—visibly if 
possible.
However, expect setbacks and roadblocks and be ready to address them as 
they occur. There will always be bumps on the road, so do not put the pressure on yourself or the stakeholders to be perfect. Just deal with these issues 
as they arise, and learn the lessons they will teach you so you do not have to 
face them again.
Engaging stakeholders early enough and keeping them involved as partners until the end of project will help you to avoid show stoppers. They may 
not understand the details of project management, but if you help them 
meet their business goals, they will join you in celebrating excellent project 
performance.
