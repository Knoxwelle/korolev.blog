100 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Roadmaps: What 
Have We Done 
for You Lately?

Good communicati on inside and outside the project team is a 
key factor in the success of any project. An important communication tool 
for all projects is the official project roadmap. The project plan helps your 
immediate project team chart a course for change at the task level. By contrast, 
the project roadmap allows the broader stakeholder community to understand 
the change that will happen at a higher level. The project roadmap is a vehicle 
that helps to communicate the planned changes, the timeframes for specific 
changes, and the impact these changes will have on the business.
So how does one go about creating a project roadmap? First, enlist the input 
of top project stakeholders. What features are important to them? What’s the 
priority level of each of these features? Are there things happening within 
the business that will make it important to have particular features ready by 
a specific date? Capture the voice of the customer and use this as the foundation for a draft roadmap.
Next, create a draft of the roadmap that shows a list of high-level features 
grouped into a realistic timeframe (quarterly works well typically). For each 
feature, describe the business value (e.g., reduce time to place an order by 
two minutes; reduce cost to place an order by $10) on the roadmap. If the 
business value cannot be described, you should question the validity of 
including the feature in the project. In short, items without tangible business 
value shouldn’t appear on your roadmap, and they warrant further scrutiny 
in the form of a cost/benefit analysis.

Once a good draft has been created, get feedback from the project’s executive 
sponsor as well as from the project stakeholders. Provide a live forum for 
discussion that allows stakeholders to ask for clarity, voice concerns regarding prioritization, and alert the team to items that are missing from the roadmap. These frank discussions build understanding of the project and help to 
ensure that the roadmap is in alignment with stakeholder priorities. Adjust 
the draft according to the input received. Ideally, after completing this step, 
you’ll have a roadmap which is supported by all key stakeholders.
Finally, shout it out loudly—post the roadmap prominently on the project 
website, present it to secondary stakeholder groups, and use it as a primary 
communication tool for the projects. Review the roadmap quarterly to make 
sure you are on track. Tell stakeholders what has been completed and what 
will be coming during the next quarter. If delays make it necessary to revise 
the roadmap, go back to the draft stage and repeat. Communicate the newly 
revised plan to all involved.
This method of creating a project roadmap gives project stakeholders a voice 
and lets them know what to expect. And last, but by no means least, it affords 
your team a regular method by which to communicate to others what it has 
successfully delivered during previous quarters.
