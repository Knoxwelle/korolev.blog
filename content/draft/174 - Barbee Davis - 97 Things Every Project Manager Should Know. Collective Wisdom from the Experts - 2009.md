148 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Scope Change 
Happens; Get 
Used to It
Pavel Simsa, PMP
Bellevue, Washington, U.S.
If there is one thing that distinguishes a software development project 
from other project types, it is how, inevitably, scope changes occur. Not that it 
never happens in other places, but I can’t think of another industry with such 
a constantly fluctuating scope.
You know projects are governed by the triple constraint: cost, time, and scope:
•	 Cost. If your project is in trouble, throwing in extra money or resources 
rarely helps. If you double the number of diggers, you’ll probably get your 
trench dug in just slightly more than half the time. But if you double the 
number of software developers, hoping to get the project back on track, 
it will probably do more harm than good. You will create huge confusion 
over who owns what code and how things need to be done. So cost needs 
to stay the same.
•	 Time. There’s always “The Date.” It is not the delivery date indicated in 
your original schedule. Nobody officially mentions it out loud, but if 
you are developing a big security product that is scheduled to release in 
November, there is a likely chance you will get to keep your job even if 
your delivery slips until January. Secretly, the team knows “The Date” is 
February, for example, “at the time of the international Black Hat security conference where new releases are announced.” You have some flexibility surrounding your delivery time, but only a small amount. Time 
is constrained.
•	 Scope. What remains to change is the scope. Oddly enough, scope is one 
of the most flexible constraints, especially when developing commercial 
software, rather than software built and customized for a specific customer. 
The reason is simple. Every new software product has “must have” and 
“nice to have” features and functionality. The “nice to have” features typically outnumber the “must have” features several times over.

Fortunately, the “nice to have” items are also the easiest to eliminate. If you 
are building a skyscraper, you can’t announce in the middle of the project, “In 
order to get this project back on track, we’ll only build 40 stories on this building, rather than the 60 stories the architectural plans show. We can add the 
other 20 later, when we have the time.”
With software, it’s relatively easy to say, “Change of plans—we’ll support only 
two operating systems in Release One. Later, we can add the other two we 
originally planned to support.”
It’s not an ideal solution, so what can be done to avoid it? Honestly speaking, 
probably nothing. It’s the nature of software development projects. However, 
what you can do is to plan your scope concretely. Identify the “nice to have” 
features and their dependencies from the beginning. The dependencies are 
important. Removing a “nice to have” feature may otherwise also change the 
development architectures linked to a “must have.”
If you plan possible scope reductions from the beginning, it will make your 
decision about what to cut and how to cut it easier, should it become necessary.
