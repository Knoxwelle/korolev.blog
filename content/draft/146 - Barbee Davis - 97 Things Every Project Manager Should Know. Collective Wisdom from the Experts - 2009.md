120 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
A Project Depends 
on Teamwork
Lelio Varella, PMP
Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
A Project is an endeavor of a multidisciplinary nature . It can be 
seen as a collective effort, jointly performed by people of great diversity. Once 
deployed according to their own unique skills and competencies, and properly 
coordinated, team members are able to produce major results and fulfill the 
expectations of the project’s stakeholders. If we look to an information technology solution development project, for example, we may identify different 
participant activity and group categories:
•	 Activities. Business Processes Review, Information Technology Solutions 
and Services Definition, Products and Services Development, and New 
Processes and Services Activation.
•	 Groups. Client Business Area Team, Information Technology Department Team, and Outside Service Providers Team.
Project activities are work units requiring the participation of individuals from 
different groups within the organization, and eventually participants from 
external organizations, such as vendors and service providers.
These groups are formed by people with different centers of knowledge and 
competence who, in practice, manage and/or carry out the project activities. 
The members of each group are usually involved in a set of unique activities 
within the project.
To work effectively and produce a positive result in the project environment, 
the allocation of responsibilities should tie directly to individuals and not to 
the departments or organizations to which people belong. These responsibility 
assignments should be documented in the project plan.
Depending on their own abilities, and on the nature of the activity, each individual can act simultaneously in various roles during a project. An individual 
may act as a leader in one situation and a participant in another.

The overall participation and contribution to the project results from each 
group is measured by the collective sets of activities the group’s members complete. Whereas individual responsibilities may be shown in a responsibility 
matrix, a joint vision of the activities and overall responsibilities of each group 
participating in the project is necessary as well.
In every project, there are diversities involved, nowhere more obviously than in 
software development projects. Teamwork depends on two key principles that 
need to coexist and work together to allow success: delegation and responsibility.
Delegation should follow the pattern documented in the project’s work breakdown structure. Split the work to be done. Then split the assignments to get 
the work done accordingly. This is the only viable way for human beings to 
understand, execute, and manage really big projects.
To delegate you need to take into consideration the adequate combination of 
technical and managerial competencies required for each task. Once you’ve 
delegated, do not interfere. As the software project manager, you are needed 
to monitor, give support, and ask about results. In doing so, you will provide 
motivation, earn respect, and foster team member “response-ability.”
“Response-ability” includes taking full responsibility. Remember this when 
delegating, as well as when accepting assignments. Match the person’s skills 
and abilities to the task.
Once leadership, delegation, and responsibility are in place, each supports the 
other. Better results are almost guaranteed. And this leads to project success.
