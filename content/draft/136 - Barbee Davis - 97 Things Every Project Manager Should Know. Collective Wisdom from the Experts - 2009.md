110 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
You Get What 
You Measure
Naresh Jain

It is a well-known fact that if you measure the wrong things, you 
encourage wrong behavior. Software teams suffer daily because their managers are tracking and measuring them against the wrong parameters.
For example, measuring how many hours someone works encourages team 
members to clock in longer hours. Studies show that working longer hours 
does not necessarily produce better results. In most cases, it actually results in 
poorer work quality.
Similarly, measuring and focusing on the team’s velocity (amount of functionality completed by the team in a time span) encourages more work to be done 
faster, but does not necessarily ensure the most important/critical work is 
being chosen. Therefore, this approach does not solve the real business problem of completing software development both quickly and bug-free.
Focusing on how many bugs the testers report encourages the testers to report 
more bugs, but not necessarily to report issues with maximum business impact. 
If developers are measured based on how many bugs are filed against them, 
testers can become their enemy. This leads to unnecessary team tensions.
In my experience, more software, done faster, does not mean successful software. Rapid software development is good for getting feedback quickly, but 
building real products needs a lot more than just development speed.
Often when I visit dysfunctional teams, it turns out that the teams were measured using the wrong parameters. Hence the team adapted and optimized 
itself for those poorly chosen parameters. Lacking the understanding of the

project’s purpose or vision led to team members defining their own success 
criteria and measuring themselves against their own respective, disconnected, 
dysfunctional parameters. Incorrect measurement does more harm than good.
Good project managers ensure that everyone on the team really understands 
what success means. They help build a common vision and shared understanding within the team. They encourage team collaboration by building 
win-win situations, so that each team member has the same focus and is working toward the common goals. They help the team identify what really needs 
to be measured. The secret sauce of successful projects is in using metrics as a 
means to an end and not as a deliverable in their own right.
I find if I try to measure 10 different things at once, it gets very confusing and 
distracting for the team. Limiting myself to measuring two or three parameters at a time, however, is very effective. These two to three parameters should 
be unanimously decided by the team based on current issues hurting the team, 
or on risks that the team feels will impact it in the near future.
Once the issue is resolved or the risk is mitigated, the team should remove the 
old checks and replace them with new items added to its metrics. A team that 
does not periodically change its metrics is symptomatic of a bigger problem.
Be sure that what you are measuring is of value, and know that it may change 
during the project. You get what you measure, so be sure you are measuring 
the right things.
