124 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Fallacy of the 
Big Round Ball
David Wood
Fredericksburg, Virginia, U.S.
Picture a ball, manufactured to be perfectly spherical, perfectly smooth. 
The only design requirement for this ball is that its diameter be exact when 
measured at any point. This ball is polished, and polished, and polished some 
more, until it is perfect. Once no defects can be found, all work on the ball 
stops. It may not be changed. It is perfection.
Does that sound like any software project you have ever worked on? I didn’t 
think so. Software just doesn’t work like that.
Software changes constantly throughout its life cycle. Design decisions, so 
often based on initial requirements, suddenly seem restrictive when new 
requirements emerge. Hacks to adapt the code to new requirements violate the 
design and make the code progressively less maintainable. The ball, however 
round it was intended to be, becomes battered and bruised.
The Fallacy of the Big Round Ball is the delusion that software system 
requirements don’t change appreciably after delivery or, worse, that they can 
be controlled.
Early software engineering researchers believed that if requirements could be 
fully understood before coding began, there would be no maintenance crisis. Some took note of problems created by post-delivery changes to requirements and labeled them evil; static requirements yielded more stable systems. 
Some sought to limit a user’s right to request changes (e.g., “Reduce the need 
for change maintenance by planning for and controlling user enhancements” 
was one of a list of “solutions to maintenance” suggested by James Martin and 
Carma McClure in 1983).

Unfortunately, such strict controls have the unintended side effect of making a 
software system less useful to its end-users. Such decisions, often based upon 
short-term economics, were greatly responsible for the alienation of information technology departments from their user bases in the 1990s and the 
subsequent development of smaller, often duplicate, software systems within 
business units during that period.
The sands of requirements constantly shift under our feet. Requirements for 
software projects change for some very good, and very simple, reasons. First, 
they can. Software is a malleable medium. It is generally much more cost effective to change software than to make equivalent changes to hardware.
Second, users of software most often exist within competitive environments. 
They compete with one another and with other organizations. As they struggle 
to compete, they turn to the most malleable parts of their systems for new 
advantages. Software’s flexibility is enticing.
If we give up on the Fallacy of the Big Round Ball, we can become more comfortable with changing requirements and see software malleability for what it 
is: a huge advantage that we control. Requirements will change. We will have 
to maintain our code. We will have to inject new requirements that will lead to 
violations of our designs. That is a feature, as the saying goes, not a bug.
We can design adaptable software, but only if we adapt our thinking first. 
Adaptability, flexibility of design, and readiness for change should be the 
cornerstones of any new software project.
