192 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know

Management 
Governance

A project can interact with a wide group comprised of team 
members, vendor team members, customers or project sponsors, operational 
teams, contract teams, financial teams, and other relevant stakeholders. In this 
scenario, where the project involves a large group of people, a variety of situational things can jeopardize the project.
If you are a software project manager coming from an information technology 
background, it may be helpful for you to know how to fit into the larger view 
of project management outside your department.
Governance is a management method that is used to develop, communicate, 
implement, and monitor polices, procedures, practices, and other acts used to 
run a project. Putting an effective project governance structure and procedure 
into place helps ensure the project alignment, monitoring and controlling of 
threats and opportunities, decision making, and delivery of project packages 
that are focused on the project planned. It allows you to appropriately address 
the risk and consequently meet the project requirements.
To be effective, the project governance should be planned in advance. Address 
relevant items in its framework like the governance goals and objectives; the 
structure; the principles; the process, procedures, and standards; communication; reporting relationships; escalation procedures (what, when, how, by 
whom); tools; clearly defined and applied responsibilities and accountabilities; 
measurements and criteria for measurements; quality; meeting and steering 
committees; audits; and monitoring and control.
Bear in mind that the governance can be affected by a series of factors: environmental, sector, industry, company culture, and legislation. For example, in a 
functional organization you, as project manager, may be directly reporting to a

functional manager rather than to a portfolio or program manager. The project 
manager has the most power in a projectized organization, where all work is set 
up as projects. However, in a functional organization model, you could report 
directly to a line or department manager, effectively weakening your power.
So, consider the organizational hierarchy when you plan and define the governance architecture. The structure can be modified, as needed, based on the 
evolution and progress of the work in order to keep the project aligned with its 
planned goals and objectives. On a large project, align your work with larger 
program or portfolio objectives and goals. But create or adapt a project governance model, even if you manage a very small project.
Typically, the project management office (PMO) is responsible for defining 
and managing project-related procedures and processes, and creating the templates that should be followed.
The project board is an organizational body responsible for assuring that the 
project goals are achieved. It provides support for addressing the project risks 
appropriately, and for other issues as well. Some other board functions follow:
•	 Approving project plans and changes to the plan
•	 Collecting input for progress reporting
•	 Ensuring compliance with policies, procedures, standards, and requirements
•	 Providing guidance on risks and issues
•	 Reviewing project progress
Project governance should operate in an integrated fashion with other organization’s governance structures when the project is interacting with other companies.
