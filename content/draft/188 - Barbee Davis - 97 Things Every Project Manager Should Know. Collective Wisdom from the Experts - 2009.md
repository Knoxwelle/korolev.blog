162 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Fallacy 
of Status
Udi Dahan

After a successfu l first project, I confidently embarked on my second. This was a larger project, it was more strategic to my employer, and I 
would manage a multidisciplinary team of people. I was sure that the skills that 
had served me the first time around wouldn’t fail. Interestingly enough, it was 
my trust in my team’s status reports that was my eventual undoing.
About two months into the project, my infrastructure team lead confessed, “It 
turns out some of the architectural assumptions we made were unfounded.” 
However, he assured me that, “We’ll be back on track by the end of the month.” 
Despite his reassurances and the contingency buffers I had in place, I couldn’t 
dismiss the sense that something was wrong.
At the end of the month, I followed up with the same team lead. He showed 
me how the refactoring work had been completed on schedule and how the 
developers were all set to hit their targets for the coming month. When I sat 
down with my integration team lead, she notified me that everything looked 
good from her vantage point, too. Modules were complying with their specifications, each had been sufficiently tested, and all the multiple layers of the 
architecture tested stable enough for the first integration.
After a slightly bumpy first integration (as many of them are) and a regular 
quality assurance cycle, I was astounded to discover that almost every use case 
had critical bugs in it. We were almost 5 months into the 15-month schedule, 
but nowhere near a third done with our project work.

I remained certain that all the team members would pull together to finish 
on time. One month before we were supposed to be going live, everyone was 
reporting that their work was at least 95% done. However, when I brought in 
one of our real users to try the system out, she told me in no uncertain terms, 
“This is broken in so many ways, I couldn’t stand working with anything like 
it.” That didn’t sound like a project 95% done to me.
An experienced project manager, Patrick, was brought in to “save the day.” 
While Patrick, the project savior, (and today, my mentor) was getting things 
back on track, he explained to me the fallacy of status. The customer defines 
“done,” not a status report.
The fact that the database team reported 95% completion had no real bearing 
on whether our users could use what we developed. Even if the status reports 
looked perfect, they were giving an incorrect view of the project progress. In 
short, the project was doomed, practically from day one, because I wasn’t mapping to the goals of the project.
I finally understood why I always needed to work with users to have them 
evaluate each feature as it was created, to be sure it added customer-perceived 
value. That way, the project status reports, converted to earned-value reports, 
show the true percentage of earned value created rather than only showing 
how much work is left.
