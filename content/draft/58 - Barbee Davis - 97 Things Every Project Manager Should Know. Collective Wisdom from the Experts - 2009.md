32 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Go Ahead, Throw 
That Practice Out
Naresh Jain

What do successfu l teams do that others don’t? They constantly 
question their own practices and try to eliminate wasteful ones. They mercilessly refactor their processes along with their software.
Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n’y a plus rien à ajouter, 
mais quand il n’y a plus rien à retrancher. This French quote from Antoine de 
Saint Exupéry means “Perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more 
to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”
Why don’t teams apply this principle today? Why is it that over a period of 
time, the value of the end product gets thinner and thinner, and the process 
and byproducts get bulkier and bulkier? Why do the lines of code expand, 
while the useful features of the software become fewer and fewer?
Key indicators that things are “broken” in the software development processes:
•	 The software bloats up in terms of lines of code and useless features
•	 The team building the software keeps growing in size
•	 The process gets more and more prescriptive, dogmatic, and rigid
•	 The team is experiencing “death by planning” meetings 
•	 The amount of documents and supporting artifacts increases exponentially 
•	 Newly discovered bugs keep pouring in from customer test groups
Team leaders have a tendency to keep adding more processes, more checks, 
and more audits, thinking that an increasingly stringent process will solve the 
problem. In my experience, it’s never a process issue. Adding more processes 
will only make it that much more difficult for the team to see the root cause of 
the real problem.

Why is it that most teams are afraid to throw away practices that are not really 
helping the team? Why do teams start off with as many practices they can 
think of, instead of adding the practices just in time?
This could be a symptom of the team not really understanding why it is using 
the process in the first place. Or it could mean that someone who does not 
fully understand the software development process is forcing a heavy-handed 
methodology upon the team. In either case, the project becomes a “house of 
cards” ready to disintegrate into a useless pile of code bits. Trying to change 
anything, without understanding the true reason the project is expanding 
without adding value, is useless.
In my opinion, a good project manager should have a healthy grasp of how the 
team is working. He/she should be able to stand back and evaluate how each 
process imposed on the team impacts the throughput of functional software.
A knowledgeable project manager should sift through all the possible activities a team might be asked to do and retain only those that are vital to the 
success of this specific project. Once the leftover practices from projects past 
are swept away, the team’s productivity and throughput should get better in a 
short period of time.
“Less is more” is a very important philosophy when it comes to process.
