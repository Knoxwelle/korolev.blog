106 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Alice Doesn’t Live 
Here Anymore

Current discussions among software developers tend to revolve 
around the best programming language, systems architecture, operating platform, or project methodology. No one seems to notice that one of our team 
members, Alice, doesn’t live here anymore. Where does Alice live now, and 
how will it affect our software development plans?
She may live in India, where English is often trained phonetically, perhaps by a 
script. Plan to allow extra time, or use written exchanges, to give Alice the best 
chance to perform her part of the development, undaunted by the language 
barrier.
Alice may live in Africa. With a smaller pool of technical talent, people may be 
more important than projects to her employer. Technology may be limited, so 
don’t assume 24-hour email, phone, and Internet connectivity.
Perhaps Alice has a wonderful job in a developing country. If she doesn’t 
respond right away on conference calls, she may be experiencing a 30-second 
satellite delay between when you talk and when she hears your words. You’ll 
get the same gap with her answers or comments.
School yourself in the decision-making differences you may encounter with 
team members from Japan. Anticipate more respect for age and experience. 
Alice’s youth may make it inappropriate or offensive for her to speak up. Japanese team members may also expect group consensus before any information 
from the meeting is captured in writing.
If you have many Alices in multiple remote locations, you will need to carefully research numerous small issues to allow your team to function smoothly:
•	 What are the union agreements where Alice works? Are her working 
hours different? Can she work overtime or weekends, come in early, or 
work through lunch hours or breaks?

•	 When do the holidays occur in the country where Alice lives? You’ll want 
to plan any important group meetings with everyone’s convenience in 
mind. You wouldn’t ask an American employee to come in on Christmas 
morning.
•	 What are the accounting practices in Alice’s homeland? Do your reporting 
cycles coincide with payroll cycles in other places?
•	 Is there any unexpected data export control? Some places in Europe exert 
tight control over data transmissions. You may be able to send information to Alice, but can she send you data in return?
•	 Customer service practices may vary from country to country. If Alice 
is customer-facing, be sure she knows your team’s service standards and 
quality expectations.
•	 If you are frustrated by a lack of voice mail, consider that several developing 
countries feel that it is an automated machine that takes a person’s muchneeded job. Be respectful when you find cultural differences regarding 
technology.
•	 Do you always expect Alice to come in during the middle of the night 
to accommodate your 9 a.m. meeting every Tuesday? Respect all team 
members by looking for the least distasteful meeting times, or rotate the 
unpleasant times among all locations.
We are fortunate to have the brilliant minds and insightful viewpoints of a 
virtual team. Be sure to use this bounty respectfully.
