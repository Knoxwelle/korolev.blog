160 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Teach the Process
Richard Sheridan
Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.
For a process to be truly effective there must be a common understanding of the process among all stakeholders. One of the ways we make sure 
this happens at my organization is to teach formal classes in our processes 
to all stakeholders involved in a project. The stakeholders include the project 
sponsors, perhaps some key users, the project managers, the developers, the 
designers, and the quality assurance specialists. And, we teach them the process together in the same class setting.
We require our clients to take a class in our process during the course of their 
project. The reason? We want to ensure that the sponsors of the project understand how to steer the team in an effective manner. We combat unrealistic 
expectations with a commonly understood agile process that incorporates 
weekly estimating, planning, and show and tell.
Sponsors are taught our estimating practice so that they know how to treat 
our estimates (estimates are not fixed-price bids). They are taught a simple 
planning technique that chooses scope based on these estimates and is crosschecked with business value. They actively participate in weekly “Show and 
Tells,” which ensure that misunderstandings are exposed as quickly as possible.
Once, I was teaching a class in our process and I called on two of our developers in the class to explain the rules of accountability around estimating. I 
stated, “Ted and Kealy, you will never be punished at this company for missing 
an estimate.” I then turned to our project manager in the class and said, “Lisa, 
you understand that you are not to pressure or punish our developers if they 
miss their estimates.” I then faced the paying client in the room and explained, 
“And Jen, you understand that if we go over our estimate, you will pay more 
for the work?”

Of course, at this point, I have two developers who think I’m tricking them 
and a client who’s ready to cancel the project! I then explain the last “rule” of 
accountability around estimating. “Kealy, Ted, the one thing I need from you 
both is that as soon as you think you are going to blow an estimate, speak up 
and tell your project manager. And Lisa, as software project manager, you can 
have a discussion about the task with them to ensure that they haven’t changed 
the scope of the task since the estimate was created. If, in fact, the estimate will 
be missed, you must then call the client and ask them what they want to do.”
Finally, I turned to our client. “Jen, here’s what you get out of all this. More 
aggressive estimates, more work in less time since the estimating environment 
is a trusting one, and dedicated team members who enjoy striving to meet 
their own estimates. However, you must be willing to accept that every once in 
a while, we’ll make a mistake. And when we do, we’ll inform you before we’ve 
spent all the money.”
Teaching the process is a powerful empowerment tool!
