112 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Don’t Fall into 
the “Not Invented 
Here” Syndrome
Dr. Paul Giammalvo, CDT, CCE, MScPM

Project management is nothing more than a set of processes, and when 
integrated and combined, these processes result in a methodology. And those 
processes/methodologies have nearly unlimited application.
There are five sets or groups of processes associated with project management:
•	 Initiation. Those processes that authorize or recognize that a project 
exists.
•	 Planning. Those processes that enable us to identify what needs to be 
done and how to go about doing it.
•	 Executing. The actual execution of processes identified in the planning 
phase to produce results.
•	 Monitoring and Controlling. Those processes where we assess whether 
the project is progressing in accordance with the plan.
•	 Closing. Those processes that identify whether what we did was done 
on time, within the allocated budget, and in substantial conformance to 
the specifications so that the project achieved the results for which it was 
undertaken.
The information technology sector has been particularly reluctant to look at 
what others are doing in project management. It doesn’t appear to adapt or 
adopt “best practices” from those sectors that are more advanced or mature in 
order to increase the success rate of IT projects.
The two great sectors to use as benchmarks are medicine and commercial aircraft piloting. Why? Because both medicine and commercial airline piloting 
embody project management into their delivery systems. For medicine it is 
each operation or procedure, and for commercial airline piloting it is each

flight from point A to point B. But more importantly from the perspective of 
IT, the comparative success rate in both medicine and commercial flight is 
extremely enviable.
So what practices do medicine and commercial aircraft piloting have that IT 
does not? First, there is the near-total authority of the doctor/pilot in making decisions. The flip side of that is people in these positions assume total 
accountability, both financial and professional. In the case of commercial 
pilots, they risk their own lives if they make a mistake.
Second, neither medicine or commercial piloting accepts “average” practices. 
PMI’s PMBOK® Guide states that the project management body of knowledge 
represents those skills, tools, and techniques that are “generally recognized as 
good practice.”
Third, project management as implemented in the fields of medicine and commercial airlines is not a standalone methodology. It exists, and is successful, 
largely because project management is fully and inextricably linked with asset 
management (departments that are responsible for the allocation and use of 
organizational assets to fund projects) and operations management (departments 
that generate revenues for an organization by handling its day-to-day work). 
Information technology projects cannot be successful in any organization without asset management providing adequate organizational resources, and operations management, as an internal customer, having realistic expectations.
Software project managers need to be willing to look outside their own IT 
world and learn what has been successful in other applications of project management, especially medicine and commercial airline piloting, which enjoy 
significantly higher success rates than do IT projects.
