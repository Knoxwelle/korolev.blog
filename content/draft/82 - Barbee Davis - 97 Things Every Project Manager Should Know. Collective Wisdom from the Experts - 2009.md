56 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Developers 
Unite—PMOs 
Are Advancing

If you’re a software developer, you are probably convinced that a 
more responsive, adaptable framework is your best chance of producing working software. Unfortunately, the rest of the world is moving to have a more 
standardized approach throughout all departments. This is good news for 
everyone except software developers.
A recently emerging concept in organizational structure is the project management office (PMO). This global phenomenon tasks a small group of individuals with the supervision and support of enterprise projects and programs. 
The group’s purpose is to introduce consistency in documents and templates, 
standardize reporting processes, and provide a uniform way to add business 
value through projects.
PMOs are intended to be centers of intelligence and coordination. They link 
strategic business objectives to employees’ actions within departmental projects through unified portfolio management, program management, and project 
management practices. This is a good thing for your job security.
The PMO’s functions within the business can be:
•	 Strategic. In this role, the members of the Project Management Office 
complete functions of identification, selection, and prioritization of the 
projects that are most closely aligned with the organization’s strategic 
planning.
•	 Directive. To fulfill their directive responsibilities, PMO employees define 
guidelines, standards, and templates. They evaluate and choose how software project managers should apply the best practices, tools, techniques, 
and software to successfully complete the goals of their development 
teams.

•	 Supportive. The PMO provides support to team members and project 
managers. This may manifest itself as training classes, adjusting templates 
and documents to make them work in all departments, or working with a 
project manager on staffing or other human resource issues.
Project Management Offices are not identical from corporation to corporation 
around the world. Each business is at a different developmental stage with its 
project management practices. So, the common name of PMO may encompass numerous hybrid responsibilities drawn from the aforementioned list, or 
unique ones not mentioned.
The PMO provides guidance in suitable standardized and validated tools, 
techniques, and software, thereby reducing problems due to uncertainty and 
the growing emphasis on cheaper/better/faster projects. The PMO applies a 
standardized methodology where necessary and effective: project identification, data collection, analysis, information gathering, distribution, reporting, risk management, procurement, quality, and other project management 
knowledge areas such as documentation and communications.
The theme of economic success through a PMO model is a hot topic in international congresses, seminars, and recently published papers. Academic discussions are prolific, because of a growing need to match university experiences 
with actual “real world” practices. The students of today are the developers of 
tomorrow.
PMOs are here to stay. If you are currently a software developer, you should 
be proactive in opening a dialog with your PMO. Communicate your professional success stories and the uniqueness of the software development process. If you don’t, you are liable to be saddled with methods, documentation 
requirements, and procedures that don’t fit your needs. Fast, good, high-quality 
software is in everyone’s best interest.
