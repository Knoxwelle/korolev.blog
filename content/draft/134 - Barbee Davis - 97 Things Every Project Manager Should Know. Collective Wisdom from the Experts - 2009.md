108 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Avoiding Contract 
Disputes
Jorge Gelabert, PMP

Project managers who have been certified as Project Management 
Professionals (PMP)Â® are familiar with the various types of contracts. They 
know that the type of contract to use depends not only on the products and 
services being purchased, but also on the level of risk they and the seller are 
willing to assume. What they may not always be aware of is that even the best 
contract does not guarantee that disputes will not arise.
Well-defined requirements are an obvious way of avoiding those possible conflicts. If the contract clearly defines what is expected, both parties will agree 
on what the deliverables will be. However, well-defined requirements are 
not always a reality in the world of project management. Some sellers (your 
sales team) may underbid a proposal with the expectation that the inevitable 
changes orders from the customer will allow them to recover the profit margin 
they are losing in order to get the business. Even when projects are bid well 
and there is a firm, well-defined agreement as to the project scope, changes 
may arise that both parties must address. These, and any number of other 
unique scenarios, can become possible areas of dispute.
So what can the project manager do? Approach the project with a mindset that 
the customer is a partner, not an adversary. If both the seller (you) and buyer 
(your customer) are invested in the success of the project, disagreements that 
arise can be easily and amicably resolved. If each side is too focused on its 
own interests, small disagreements can evolve into major conflicts and derail 
a project.

When disagreements arise, work to resolve them in such a way that both parties come out as winners. Even when the contract supports your position, 
negotiate. While you may feel that you would be proven right in a court of 
law, the damage to the relationship, and the obvious stalemate of the project 
while the case is being resolved, will impact the ultimate success of the project. 
While there may be situations when pursuing a legal option is all that is left, it 
should be a last resort.
The best way to avoid possible conflicts is to be fair when negotiating the contract. For example, if the contract has penalties, make sure it includes bonuses 
as well. Both parties need to feel they have an equal chance to win and lose. 
Even with a fixed-price contract, it may be better to renegotiate than to have 
the buyers (your customers) walk away from the project because they feel they 
have more to lose by completing the project than by abandoning it.
Also, beware of the bid that feels too good to be true. If your sales team is not 
presenting a competitive bid, it may mean that your buyers do not fully understand what is required to complete the work of the project. Once they become 
aware that they are overpaying, they will likely try to renegotiate, or walk away.
