82 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Planning for Reality

It’s amazing how often software projects tend to fall into late, 
over-budget, off-quality situations. Even in highly touted software shops with 
international certifications and maturity assessments lining the walls, the trials of managing the very fluid environment of software development are many.
The pace of development will naturally vary throughout the life of the project. Sometimes you are ahead of schedule, sometimes behind. Often, project 
managers seek to control these fluctuations through strict, elaborate project 
timelines that lay out prescribed task assignments and deadlines. However, 
they find themselves making multiple revisions to the plan along the way to 
deal with the dynamic nature of creating software.
While the development and execution of a detailed, keenly estimated project 
plan is important in the success of any project, many software project managers may find some benefit in adding some “reality time” into their plans.
The critical chain method uses the concept of “buffers” as one means to deal 
with inherent variance over the life cycle of the project. Try introducing “buffer time” or “reality time” into your schedule at each phase of your software 
development life cycle (design, coding, testing, etc.).
Buffer time allows for a degree of flexibility within a phase without the need 
to perform major scheduling adjustments. Think of this buffer time as a time 
contingency reserve for the phase. The process is fairly straightforward. Look 
at each phase of your project, consider the total duration of the phase based on 
your best planning, and then add a buffer task at the end of the phase that has 
a duration of a percentage of the total phase duration, say 10% or so.

For example, on a 40-day total duration for a design phase, add 4 days of buffer time to the end of the phase, for a total phase duration of 44 days. Will the 
phase actually take 44 days? Perhaps not, but the “unused” time can then be 
either carried forward or added to future buffers.
As experienced software project managers know, projects may proceed on 
schedule during the early stages, only to end up dragging on later in the 
process. Getting ahead of the curve almost always has more advantages than 
disadvantages.
Expect skepticism the first time you try this approach. “Nonproductive” time 
is the first thing managers will want to eliminate when they review your schedule. Stand your ground. Make the simple point that you are performing basic 
schedule risk management.
If you have a phase of the project that is riskier than another, add more buffer 
at that point. You may be able to add less of a risk buffer in other spots on the 
timeline.
Last, make sure that you are not “double-dipping.” Double-dipping would be 
adding extra time at the task level and then again at the phase level. The technique works best when you are not already buffering each of your task durations by routinely adding extra time to each activity to deal with the unknown.
Try it. It works!
