74 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
To Thine Own 
Self Be True
Harry Tucker

Any of us who have traveled on commercial aircraft remember that during the safety demonstration we are told to put our oxygen masks 
on first, and then to assist an elderly person or child with his or her mask. If 
we struggle to put the other person’s mask on before ours, we may succumb 
to oxygen deprivation before succeeding, and we all die. By putting ours on 
quickly, we are empowered to put % effort into taking care of others, and 
everyone lives.
I have witnessed many wonderful projects collapse over the years, even though 
the perfect storm of success was at the feet of those involved. The projects in 
question had:
•	 Unlimited market potential
•	 A superior product
•	 An empowered team enabled with phenomenal capability
However, the project manager had lost control of him-/herself and, therefore, 
could not take care of the team. The opportunity died of oxygen deprivation, 
so to speak, and the project failed.
To manage or lead teams (and there are sharp differences), software project 
managers need to be in complete control of themselves. They must have a 
strong understanding of their own personal purpose, vision, and mission, as 
well as personal and professional goals. When a solid personal life structure 
is in place, the manager’s life is empowered. Without such empowerment, the 
manager is easily swept away by the challenges of living (both inside and outside the office). Then, an otherwise intelligent, talented manager loses focus 
on the management tasks at hand.

When that happens, various symptoms start to appear, one cascading upon 
the next:
1. The manager becomes visibly distracted and starts to feel out of control.
2. Not feeling in control, he/she doesn’t feel empowered to stand up and do 
what is needed to protect the project.
3. The unprotected team starts to experience communication breakdowns.
4. Communication breakdowns lead to slipped (not aligned with the original project baseline) tasks.
5. Slipped tasks, and a manager unable to bring things back under control, 
lead to team despair.
6. Team morale fails, adding further complexity to a project that is already 
out of control.
I personally take time on a daily, weekly, and semi-annual basis to review 
where I am in my life. My daily and weekly reviews help me keep on track as 
far as short-term goals are concerned. My semi-annual retreat (white space 
planning, as some people call it) provides me with an opportunity to assess my 
long-term goals, personally and professionally, to make sure I am still on track.
While life will always throw curveballs at all of us, having short- and long-term 
goals helps provide us with targets that help us realign our personal and professional course after the turbulence has passed. With such a plan in hand, we 
are enabled to focus more on the tasks at hand, including managing our teams, 
to empower them toward success.
The oxygen masks have fallen—who are you helping first?
