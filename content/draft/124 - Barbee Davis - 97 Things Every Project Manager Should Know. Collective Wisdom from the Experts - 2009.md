98 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Holy Trinity of 
Project Management

The software project manager usually defines the role of each team 
member at the beginning of a new project, documenting why each team member’s skills are vital and the general responsibilities each person should anticipate. 
However, these documents seldom include an explanation of the software project 
manager’s role during the project life cycle.
The challenge for the project manager, especially when working with a new 
team, is to convey the essence of project management in a 30-minute overview, 
without overwhelming the team with methodology details.
With a busy organization and team members whose first priority is taking care 
of their primary work assignment, your challenge as PM is to convey, as concisely as possible, one primary point that team members will take away from 
your meeting: the “Holy Trinity,” also know as the triple constraint.
To introduce this core concept, prepare a slide or other visual depicting the 
triple constraint. This is an equilateral triangle with its three points labeled 
Time, Cost, and Scope. Together, they outline a space in their center, which 
is the project Quality. This geometric representation of the project work illustrates that increasing the length of any one of the three sides forces a corresponding change in at least one of the other sides of the triangle. Thus, change 
also affects the project quality.
Point out that this fixed relationship among the three constraints explains why 
defining scope becomes a critical first step, and a primary limitation. While 
you may have your own key points depending on the project management 
maturity of your organization, the type of project you are helming, the maturity 
of the project management effort, and past experiences with your customers, be 
sure to cover these:

•	 The importance of each team member’s individual participation on the 
project, which includes assisting with the development of the project plan.
•	 Project risks—what they are, how to identify them, and how to create and 
monitor plans to avoid, mitigate, or respond to them.
•	 Tasks needing further breakdown to define the work to be completed by 
each member of the team.
•	 Task assignments, scheduled completion dates, interdependencies of the 
tasks for the entire team, and the project manager’s role in following up to 
ensure timely completion of the assignments.
•	 Possible task completion delays, impediments to completing tasks in a 
timely manner, and the PM’s role to assist with removing roadblocks. 
•	 Communications plans, team member communication responsibilities, 
and the PM’s role as focal point in coordinating plan details.
•	 Project status meeting responsibilities and schedules.
•	 Outline of next steps you plan to perform as PM as the project plan 
unfolds.
Unless your organization is a “mature” project-oriented business, adding an 
overview of the basic PM concepts at the beginning of all projects is critical to 
assist team members in understanding the full extent of their responsibilities 
and the details of their support structure. This includes laying out your role as 
their software project manager.
