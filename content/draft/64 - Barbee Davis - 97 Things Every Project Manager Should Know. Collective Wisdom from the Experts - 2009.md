38 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Don’t Skip Vacations 
for the Project
Joe Zenevitch

Software project management is a demanding profession. Besides 
being the most visible position on the team, usually you are the only one in 
that role and you don’t have a backup. Planning time off is difficult, especially 
if you’re a third-party consultant. You feel that your absences impact the project 
unfavorably.
To minimize this risk, novice project managers cancel their vacations, or in the 
worst cases, do not plan vacations at all. I’ve learned over time that you really 
need to take periodic vacations to get a break from the stressful conditions 
that are inherent in most projects. Over the course of your career, how bitterly 
do you resent the vacations you missed? But how foggy is your memory of the 
specific issues you sidestepped by remaining on the job?
I’m not suggesting that you should plan your next vacation with no regard for 
your project or project schedule. If it’s only a three-week-duration project, you 
can wait. Taking a vacation the week before a major release would definitely 
be irresponsible. But, if your 9- to 12-month project tanks because you take a 
week or two off in the middle, then you are probably not managing it well in 
the first place.
Obviously, it is important to find and train someone to fill your role while you 
are away. He/she may not do things exactly as you would have done them, but 
your surrogate will be able to keep the project ship afloat and sailing in the 
right direction. You can make it known if you’d prefer to have major issues 
deferred until your return.

Your replacement could be a project manager from another team, but someone from your own team is probably the better choice. A team member will be 
more familiar with the project, and this gives him/her a tryout run serving in a 
leadership role. In some organizations, the business analyst can be a good fit as 
an interim “you.” This person knows the requirements intimately, and should 
know the basic mechanics of how to run your development iterations if you’ve 
been involving the stakeholders at-large all along, as you should.
In agile development, the concept of the self-directed team is both important and powerful. The idea is that the project manager puts in place easyto-understand and highly visible processes that the entire team follows. Over 
time, as the team adopts these processes, the project manager does less and less 
managing, and more and more facilitating. Essentially, removing obstacles and 
resolving issues replaces day-to-day micromanaging. 
One of the delightful byproducts of a smoothly running, self-directed team is 
that the project manager’s appropriately timed vacation can become almost a 
nonevent. Even if you are not around for a few days, the machine keeps running itself.
Certainly schedule your vacations to make sure you are available for project 
releases, but definitely take time off. And never cancel a vacation just because 
you think the project will grind to a halt without you.
