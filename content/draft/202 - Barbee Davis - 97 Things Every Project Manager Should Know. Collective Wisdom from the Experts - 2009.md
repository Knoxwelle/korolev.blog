176 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
We Are Project 
Managers, Not 
Superheroes
Angyne J. Schock-Smith, PMP

this is a tip that is useful if you’re a software project manager in information technology environments, but is also transferrable to whatever type of 
projects you manage.
“We are project managers, not superheroes,” is part of my introductory routine 
when I deliver training on project management skills. When talking about the 
characteristics of a good project manager, my favorite line is, “Get out your 
capes, people! It takes a superhero to do all a software project manager must 
do, and to do it well.” However, since this comes early in the training, I have to 
offer some hope. So I say, “OK, some of us mere mortals actually become good 
project managers. What’s the trick?”
I believe this trick has three parts:
•	 Know your personal strengths and weaknesses.
•	 Know the personal strengths and weaknesses of your team.
•	 Use this knowledge to create complementary partnerships with team 
members who possess strengths where you have gaps.
How can you get to know your personal strengths and weaknesses?
•	 Get out your copies of all the old personality or work behavior tests you’ve 
ever taken.
•	 Be honest as you extrapolate data from these old evaluations. Were you 
honest when you took the questionnaire? Does the “label” still fit, or have 
you grown and changed since that time? Which of the label’s associated 
strengths and weaknesses most accurately describe you right now?

•	 Don’t try to figure out which label would make the best project manager. 
There is no right answer to that question. A good project manager has to 
be flexible, i.e., be able to diagnose each situation and shift out of his/her 
comfort zone to respond in the most effective way.
•	 From your available data, create a fresh, current personal inventory of 
strengths and weaknesses. Keep it where you will always be able to find it 
and update it as you continue to learn more about yourself.
After that, the rest is downhill! Use an available strengths inventory to assess 
your team. Then, look for people on the team who have strengths in the areas 
listed on your personal weakness inventory.
For me (an Expressive type , if you know the Social Styles types), my weakness 
is attention to detail. I’ll always need someone (an Analytical type) to keep 
me on track in that area! If you’re likely to try to please others more than you 
should, you may need someone to help you drive the project forward more 
forcefully than you would be comfortable doing yourself.
Make sure that you have teammates with complementary skills working with 
you in areas where your weaknesses lie. But you don’t have to tell them that’s 
what you are doing, right? Keep some mystique about it, and maybe you can 
convince the team that you are a superhero. I won’t tell anyone otherwise.
