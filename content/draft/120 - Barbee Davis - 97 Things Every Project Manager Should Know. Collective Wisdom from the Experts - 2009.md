94 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Fallacy of 
Perfect Knowledge
David Wood
Fredericksburg, Virginia, U.S.
We all know in our heart of hearts that we don’t know everything. 
Every day, hopefully, we learn a bit more about our profession, our society, and 
ourselves. But we simply can’t know it all. If we stop learning we fall behind 
rapidly, especially in the software industry. The idea that one can apprentice 
to a trade and practice that trade the rest of one’s life has gone the way of the 
dodo. Remember the dodo bird? No? That’s the point.
Technology, techniques, and the ideas upon which they are built change far 
too rapidly in our era for any practitioner to know all he or she needs to know 
at any point in time. We must constantly learn and we must equally adjust to 
a state of ignorance, which requires us to spend some portion of every project 
researching the knowledge we need. Why, then, do we persist in pretending 
that we must, or even can, know everything about a software project during its 
development phase?
The history of software engineering is replete with attempts to control software 
projects, through carefully bound development and maintenance activities to 
prevent buggy, failed software. Most such methodologies, such as the classic 
“waterfall” methodology, presume that with sufficient time and up-front diligence, a software project can be completely understood. Many demand that 
requirements be set in stone before a line of code is written. What nonsense!
Giving up on knowing it all during development, we might think that we can 
know it all later. Several software development methodologies presume this,

such as the spiral or agile methodologies. Iterative development is seen as the 
key to delivering a software project encoding “final” requirements. Unfortunately for adherents of those methodologies, delivery of a software project is 
just a comma in development, not a period.
Requirements, even when “agreed” upon in detailed upfront design, will 
change during development. It is impossible to know them all in advance. 
Multiple requirements often result in inconsistencies, even when they are 
gathered from a single source. Requirements may even mean different things 
to different people. Differing interpretations may be due to perception, goals, 
or language. In order to create a successful software project, we must accept 
and even embrace these ideas. We do not know it all and we never will.
The Fallacy of Perfect Knowledge is the delusion that it is possible to capture 
complete, nonconflicting requirements for a software project. The reality is 
that requirements will never be fully known at any time during a software 
project’s life cycle—not during analysis, development, maintenance, or even 
(or especially) when the system becomes legacy.
Continuous use of the agile techniques of iteration and refactoring into the 
maintenance phase of the software life cycle begins to address some of these 
concerns. A fuller understanding of the ways that software evolves may be the 
next step. Until we have those conceptual tools, use them daily, and accept 
our ignorances big and small, we will continue to fall victim to the Fallacy of 
Perfect Knowledge.
