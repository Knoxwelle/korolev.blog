156 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Every Project 
Manager Is a Contract

As the project manager, you are responsible for change control. You put 
together a process for documenting requests and performing the changes. But 
how can you control changes when you are not aware that they happened?
The client’s team members will have direct contact with their peers in your 
team. Trying to satisfy the client, or being unaware of contractual obligations, 
a team member can agree to an extra training session, or even implement a 
change to the software, and forget to inform you—or alert you when it is too 
late. Some of those changes may be innocuous, but others could bring problems. For instance, silently altering part of the software features means the 
change may remain unmentioned in the software manual. This could lead to 
rewrites, reprinting, etc., with all the associated (an unbilled) time and cost.
One might feel tempted to prohibit interaction between members of the client’s and the contractor’s project teams, but that can jeopardize communication. Contracts don’t cover whether or not the client has the right to talk to 
your team members. And how can a project manager control whether the 
team members and the client are in contact?
To avoid undocumented changes being performed, every team member should 
be familiar with the contract, including aspects of scope, time, and each party’s 
rights and dues. They should be prepared to analyze the client’s requests when 
preparing a contract perspective and know how to alert everyone to future 
changes. This requires that the change control and handling process be documented, and that team members be familiar with it.

A workshop is a very effective tool to provide team members with knowledge 
about the most important contract aspects and the change control process. 
Hold this training at the very beginning. Alternately, you may want to include 
a session about the subject in your internal kick-off meeting agenda. Either 
way, you should make sure that every project team member is informed.
Special attention must be given to third parties working for the project, such as 
providers, suppliers, or subcontractors. Controlling the client’s access to them 
is difficult and delicate, and in some cases they may have an independent business relationship with your client. It is not uncommon to see a subcontractor 
accept a client’s request, perform it, and send the bill to you, the main contractor.
The best way to deal with this kind of problem is to avoid it. Talk to your providers and suggest that they inform people involved in your project about the 
contractual aspects of your relationship both with them and with the client. 
And introduce them to your change control process.
Remember: the success of a project is measured primarily by client satisfaction. The point is not to deny changes, but to control them. All your team 
members have to do about this is to detect a potential change and inform you 
through your change control process. This allows you to control the relationship with the client and to satisfy their needs without sacrificing time and cost.
