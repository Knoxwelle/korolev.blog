172 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Don’t Always Be 
“The Messenger”
Matt Secoske
Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.
One of the most importa nt roles of the software project manager is to 
facilitate an open dialogue between the various members of the team. Unfortunately, I have been on many projects where the opposite has happened. The 
PM became the bottleneck through which all communication flowed. He or 
she was “The Messenger,” passing precious bits of information from one team 
member to the next.
For a project to be organic as it progresses, information becomes the air and 
water feeding the code base as it grows toward fulfilling the ultimate mission 
of the project. All team members rely on a constant exchange of information. 
But if the stakeholders are forced to channel all knowledge through the PM, 
insurmountable problems are guaranteed.
The PM, after being entrusted with current updates, may not have correctly 
identified all of the developers who need to receive that information. The originator of the message thinks he/she has fulfilled any obligation by passing it 
along to the PM. Once the communication channel oversight is discovered, 
the first team member may not remember exactly what she passed along earlier, as she has since moved on to newer challenges. The PM, overwhelmed 
with technological reports he or she may not understand, quickly becomes 
incapable of being the single point of conductivity for project wisdom.
There is an even more damaging role than The Messenger, in which a wellmeaning but clueless PM becomes “The Scrambler.” As a project grows, so does 
the amount of nontechnical information needed to keep it running smoothly.

Developers need to know the business rules, the business champion needs to 
know the status of the deliverables, and various other people need insight into 
where the project stands in relation to its schedule, cost, and quality metrics.
As this amount of information grows, so does the likelihood that a nonomnipotent PM will miscommunicate. The Scrambler has struck! For example, 
a business rule that appears to have little impact on the project on the surface 
may in fact be a major roadblock once its true intent is discovered. Sizable 
changes to the code base may need to be done in order to repair the damages.
A project manager needs to get the right stakeholders together to talk about 
the right topic at the right time. Finding a time to have people from disparate 
departments available to meet may seem daunting. The practice? The PM, trying to solve a scheduling issue says, “Cheri, I’ll take this directly to Bob, and get 
back to you with the answer.” This can work for short, nontechnical questions. 
But, be aware that success in small ventures can insidiously evolve you into a 
Messenger or a Scrambler. Invariably something is missed in the translation, 
leading to excessive wasted time spent trying to sort out the repercussions.
Providing clear, open channels for communication, along with archiving discussions and decisions, allows all team members to interact directly with one 
another. This keeps The Messenger and The Scrambler project manager at bay, 
and keeps the software project moving forward.
