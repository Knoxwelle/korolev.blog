166 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Recognize the Value 
of Team Morale
David Bock
Reston, Virginia, U.S.
Morale is one of those things you know you need, but it is hard 
to grow and measure. A team with high morale will occasionally put in extra 
effort cheerfully, but a team with low morale will not. High morale isn’t just 
about a better workplace, it is about a more productive team.
A few years ago, I worked with a team that exhibited high morale. At times, 
the office felt more like a community of friends than a workplace. Productivity 
was high. We would occasionally have crises that required a little extra “push,” 
and team members would volunteer for that extra effort.
A few years later, I saw that same team at an ice cream social at the office, and 
it didn’t appear happy. The team members weren’t socializing, and their body 
language seemed cold. When I approached them, they were complaining that 
there were only “chocolate Jimmies, not colored sprinkles” as a topping for 
the ice cream. Think about that transition: same team, same project, much 
different morale. It went from cheerfully working overtime, when needed, to 
complaining about free ice cream.
How did this happen? The team had a new manager who made some bad decisions. His errors led the team down a false path and created more work for it. 
Senior management blamed the entire team. And when the manager took no 
responsibility, the team lost confidence. The project became “more work and 
less fun,” and morale suffered.
As the manager tried to improve the situation, he made things worse. He remembered that when the team members had high morale, they would occasionally 
go out to movies together. So, he instituted a “movie night.” The team had 
no interest in socializing, and attendance was low. The manager began marking on performance reviews that people weren’t “participating with the team.” 
That lowered morale even more.

In this situation, the manager had the cause and effect backward. People don’t 
have high team morale because they socialize; they are more willing to socialize because they have high morale.
As a consultant, I have tried to think about ways to measure morale. I have 
joked about metrics like “the ratio of cars in the parking lot at 5:05 p.m. and 
4:55 p.m.,” and the “number of visible Dilbert cartoons per square foot of office 
space.” But I have realized morale isn’t something to be measured, morale is
the measurement. We are measuring the team’s attitude. Morale is the measure 
of the team’s confidence in its leader, confidence in its teammates, and faith in 
its own ability to get things done.
It is your job as the software project manager to create a workplace with high 
morale. If team members respect you as their leader, and if they feel they can 
talk to you and influence the outcome of events, morale will improve.
High morale results in greater satisfaction among your employees, lower turnover, and higher productivity. On top of all that, it’s just nicer to be around 
happy people. Don’t you agree?
