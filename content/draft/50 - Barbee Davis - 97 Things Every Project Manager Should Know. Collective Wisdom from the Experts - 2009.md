24 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
How to Spot a 
Good IT Developer
James Graham, PMP
Ta’ l-Ibrag, Malta
Software project managers know that project success rests on having 
excellent developers. How do you spot stellar performers in the applicant herd?
Before new candidates interview, talk to your best developers. Have them reaffirm the specific knowledge needed. Is experience with a particular development life cycle, a specific methodology, special toolsets, or definitive sector 
knowledge (experience in the defense industry or the pharmaceutical sector, 
for example) preferable, or mandatory?
Assess knowledge. Mix interviews, involving you and trusted representatives 
from your development team, with theoretical tests. A good software engineer 
will be able to fix “mock” syntax errors immediately and without any mental 
stress. He or she can read other people’s code and understand its intent without extensive documentation or glyph-by-glyph translation. When presented 
with a programming problem, your candidate should be able to spot it and 
then describe it in both “developer geek” and in language appropriate for noninformation technology stakeholders.
We all think “more is better” when hiring programming skills. But how do we 
define “more”? Although a candidate may have excellent knowledge, this person may not yet have developed the finesse to employ it effectively. A recent 
graduate or newly trained developer may struggle to apply the theoretical 
knowledge gained in an educational context when facing a demanding realworld project. When tight deadlines squeeze the time to explore solutions, 
and intense pressures from the client and other stakeholders loom, you need 
experience on top of raw knowledge.
Ask the applicant/developer to write code for review by you and your team. 
After analyzing the code and talking with your trusted developers, you will 
sense whether this person’s approach and style will fit your team.

Consider the candidate’s attitude toward work, coworkers, clients, and stakeholders. I once worked with a developer known as “The Hair Dryer.” Legend 
has it that when he was upset, he could blow people’s hair dry with his shouting. He was an excellent developer, but a detriment to a project team.
As the world moves toward agile development methodologies, cross-functional 
communication and soft skills will increase in importance. Developers will 
find themselves working in small teams with people from elsewhere in the 
organization. How well will your potential new teammate represent you when 
unleashed into the wild? Follow these simple guidelines when hiring software 
developers:
•	 Screen them to check for the right knowledge of development life cycles, 
methodologies, toolsets, and their industry/sector familiarity.
•	 Test them to see a demonstration of their ability to apply their knowledge 
in your workplace.
•	 Check out their communication and social skills.
•	 Look for the right attitude toward the work: a balance of desire to create high-grade products while accepting the project constraints. Is there 
documented evidence that they can produce products that are “fit for purpose,” on time, and within the budget?
No matter how personable and skilled your applicant, always verify credentials 
with the issuing institutions and check out resume entries with former employers. 
Careful hiring practices may prevent a multitude of future problems.
