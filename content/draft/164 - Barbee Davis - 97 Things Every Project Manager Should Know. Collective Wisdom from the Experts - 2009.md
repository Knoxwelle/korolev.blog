138 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Communicating 
Is Key
Gennady Mironov, CPM
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
The most critical knowledge the project manager in any industry 
should have is how to be a good communicator. The person may have many 
different certifications and a list of titles and accreditations after his/her name, 
but without the basic knowledge of how to collaborate with others, the work 
of the project cannot be accomplished properly.
I strongly believe that when starting a new project, the good project manager 
should meet in person with all of the stakeholders. Especially the client. The 
PM should introduce him-/herself and discuss the project goals and all the 
critical issues. If the stakeholders, client, and even the project team are not 
located on different continents, meeting in person should not be a big problem, even during an economic recession.
We say in Russia that “it’s better to see it one time than to hear it a hundred times.” 
From my own project management experience working on multimillion-dollar 
projects, I’ve found I could easily solve problems with my clients within half a 
day by visiting them in person.
On one project, we had a problem when our contractor was delaying the project schedule by not supplying us with the required wireless base station. The 
problem was that the contractor had outsourced this part of the project to its 
own subcontractor, who was late with the power supply systems. Although 
we spent weeks of calling and sending numerous emails back and fourth, we 
could not solve this problem.

Finally, I chose to meet personally with our contractor, explained the details of 
the issue, offered some possible solutions, and we were able to get our needed 
equipment. In most cases, the customer is on your side and ready to support 
you if you are willing to listen and help come up with a reasonable solution.
Another time, one of our clients insisted on a very short project schedule. He 
wanted to shorten the production cycle of the equipment at the end of the 
year, when all the factories were working at 100% capacity to close as many 
purchase orders as possible. We could not accept this, because it was twice as 
short as the standard project period.
Again, I organized a three-party meeting between our company, the client, 
and the vendor. We freely proposed the shortest, most realistic schedule, and 
explained in detail why we couldn’t shorten it more. After finishing a specially 
organized inventory to discover the number of items needed for the project 
we already had in stock, we took some risk and accepted the customer’s order 
without even receiving the order confirmation from him.
We closed the project successfully, two days ahead of that very tight schedule. 
Our client was very happy, and at the beginning of the new year offered us 
another unexpected project for another $2 million. We met schedule, scope, 
budget, and quality requirements, and in this case earned extra profit for the 
organization as a result of the project.
Software projects rest on person-to-person communication.
