114 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Favor the Now 
Over the Soon
Scott Davis

One of my favorite sayings is, “Exaggeration is a million times worse 
than understatement.” The project management variation on this is, “Now is a 
million times better than soon, and a gazillion times better than later.”
If you’re in the software development industry, you’re familiar with the “vaporware” phenomenon—software that is endlessly talked about but never actually 
delivered. We can plan the software. We can discuss the features it will have. 
But software that you can touch, run, and interact with is a million times better 
than a Word document full of requirements.
This means hurry up and write the software—now! The prototype you put 
together will instantly give you feedback about usability. Worried about performance? How can you optimize performance without the software?
Agile software methodologies favor now, over soon, by focusing on quick iterations. Often they span no more than a week or two. The idea is to get software 
written and in front of the user as quickly as possible. If users like what they 
see, you have an immediate victory. More importantly, if they don’t like what 
they see, you have failed fast.
A quick success is only a hundred times better than a late success, but a quick 
failure is a million times better than a late failure. It gives you time to rethink, 
readjust, and rewrite the software sooner rather than later. A failure one week 
before the ship date can be a showstopper. A failure early in the process gets 
forgotten by the time the software actually goes live.

If the software language or framework that you are using doesn’t let you roll 
out new features in a matter of seconds or minutes, then the tool you are using 
is part of the problem. If compiling your code takes hours instead of minutes 
or seconds, you will be less likely to build early and often. These friction points 
in the software development put you at a distinct competitive disadvantage. 
Many of the top websites that you use on a daily basis can roll out new features 
in as little as 30 minutes.
They are also industry leaders because of the quality of the software they produce quickly. They test their code incessantly. Do they wait until the end of 
the software development life cycle to write their unit and integration tests? 
Nope. They write them now. Test-first and test-driven methodologies are “de 
rigeur” in top software development shops, because if testing is important, it is 
important enough to do now.
It is not that planning isn’t a crucial part of successful software projects. 
Just do your planning based on modern software practices and expectations. 
Methodologies that date back to a time when code was written out in longhand, meticulously transferred to punch cards, and then hand-carried in a 
shoebox to a system administrator don’t translate well to an era where software 
is easy, free, and instantaneous. We are in the era of the now, and your processes should be adjusted accordingly.
