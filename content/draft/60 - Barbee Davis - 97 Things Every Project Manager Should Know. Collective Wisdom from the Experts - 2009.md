34 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Requirement 
Specifications: 
An Oxymoron
Alan Greenblatt
Sudbury, Massachusetts, U.S.
Good requirements (R) describe how features of a product are going to 
solve particular existing or potential problems. Good features (F), sometimes 
called functionality, are added to products to address those important problems. Requirements are captured by salespeople or created by software project 
managers:
•	 We can’t sell the product outside of the United States (R). We need to provide internationalization and location support (F).
•	 Users have to click five buttons to complete a very simple task. They get 
frustrated and never complete the task. We need to simplify the user interface (R) and reduce the number of button clicks to two or fewer to complete 
the same tasks (F).
Specifications (S), on the other hand, describe exactly how problems will be 
solved and the requirements will be met. Using the examples above, the following specifications might be written by systems architects:
•	 We will extract all text strings, including pop-up messages, and place 
them in external resource bundles (S).
•	 The application will be enhanced so that all text displayed on the screen 
will be retrieved from these resource bundles (S).
•	 Localization can be performed by creating specific resource bundles for 
the locales required (S).
•	 The functionality achieved through clicking buttons 1, 2, and 3 will be 
bundled into a single button click on Button A (S).
•	 The functionality of existing buttons 4 and 5 will be bundled into Button 
B (S).

Blurring the lines between requirements and specifications leads to the wrong 
people making the decisions. You either end up with the software developers 
making decisions about what features are important to a user, or with a software project manager telling a developer how to structure code. Either way, 
the result is a poor final software product.
Developers aren’t usually out talking to customers, users, marketing, sales, and 
potential partners, trying to understand what new features are most important. 
On the other hand, software project managers usually aren’t skilled developers 
who understand how best to implement a feature, and how their untrained, 
although well-meaning, specification suggestions would affect other aspects 
of the product. Each group has a unique skill set.
Having good requirements that describe the problem you are trying to solve, 
and why it is so important to solve this particular problem, lets the programmer be more flexible, efficient, and motivated during the development process. 
Coders can make independent design decisions as they work on the problem 
and understand it more thoroughly. They should only be bound by the technologies they have chosen to use, not by strict, brittle specifications created by 
a nonprogrammer.
Specifications still need to be written, but they will change. Have you come to 
the end of the product development cycle and only then fully understood how 
this product should have been built in the first place?
Keep the what you are trying to build separate from the how to build it. Then, let 
the properly trained team member make decisions based on his/her project role.
