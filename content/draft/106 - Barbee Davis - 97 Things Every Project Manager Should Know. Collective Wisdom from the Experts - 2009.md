Organizati ons ofte n group severa l related individual technology 
projects into a larger program. The strategy is to complete these projects in a more 
cost-effective way and to bring strategic benefits to the organization by avoiding 
overlap or gaps. However, it is vital that the software project manager convey to 
the project team members the real business objective that their individual project 
must achieve, as well as how this team aligns to the other projects. Team members 
must also understand how the achievement of their specific project goals contributes to the success or failure of the overall program objectives. 
Here are some key tasks:
•	 Find the connections that expand the importance of this project beyond 
its mere standalone value.
•	 Define the relationships, deliverables, and risks shared among all projects 
in the program.
•	 Keep all the team members in alignment with the final solution that the 
program is trying to achieve.
•	 Understand the business, to propose solutions aligned to the strategic 
objectives of the program as the inevitable problems appear.
This concept of bundling projects into programs is not very mature in Latin 
America yet, but we are gaining experience managing programs with a common set of governance policies. Clearly there are rich benefits to be found 
when each team has a clear vision of the entire program goals, not just its own 
project work.

The most difficult thing is getting the buy-in from vendors, clients, sponsors, and 
other stakeholders. We need to analyze their interests, requirements, and needs 
to be sure that there is value for each of them when we group technical projects. 
Every group must gain more value than if its project was completed in a vacuum.
Particularly when customers span many countries, they will all have different 
ideas of how technology should be created, and unique organizational procedures and processes. Agreement and approval on internationally recognized 
program management practices is fundamental in order to begin the alignment of all stakeholders to program goals.
To have a successful methodology, we need common, but flexible, documents 
or templates to use for all projects. When we manage information technology 
programs, we typically need goods or services from vendors with their own 
unique methodology and templates, or outputs from other projects being run 
simultaneously with our own. So, before we begin, all parties have to agree 
which documents we are going to use.
What will our project management methodology be? If individual project 
teams can’t agree on what methodology, procedures, processes, and integrated 
change control steps will be adopted by all teams, the smooth codevelopment 
of projects to serve the greater program good will fail. When choosing, the 
software project manager needs to ask the team which templates and practices 
are reasonable and useful to help it execute and control its projects efficiently.
Once you have a common process and document/template tools, you are in a 
position to coordinate technical projects into programs. These provide greater 
value to your customer and your organization than single projects done alone.
