20 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Scrolling 
Through Time
Kim MacCormack
Leesburg, Virginia, U.S.
Twelve years ago, my team was hired to develop a web application as a 
subcontractor for a graphic design firm. We were to have no direct contact 
with the customer. All of the requirements were relayed by the client to our 
prime contractor, and then passed on to us in a series of random emails.
One email concerned the screen resolution our artists should use. The previous standard had been 640×480, but more current research suggested that the 
web site should support up to an 800×600 resolution. (Today the most common 
screen resolution is 1,024×768.) Even though this was an experienced design 
firm, its formal requirements (which we never saw) to the customer stated:
The layout of each page will conform to a fixed 800-pixel width standard and 
600-pixel height standard.
If we had seen this requirement, we would have immediately corrected the 
statement to read, “The layout of each page will conform to a fixed 800-pixel 
width standard, to support up to an 800×600 monitor resolution.” Since we 
had worked on many websites, we knew that the most important dimension 
was the width. Users hate scrolling horizontally, while vertical scrolling is considered one of the realities, if not advantages, of using a browser. However, 
evidently this valuable truth was never conveyed to the customer.
The content this novice website customer provided for each web page was 
huge. As a result, very few pages could be completely viewed (lengthwise) on 
a 15-inch monitor set to an 800×600 resolution. One had to scroll vertically.

Not realizing we would have to be miracle workers to make this oversized 
content display on a single screen, the end-user customer got very upset. They 
blamed our prime contractor, the design shop. In return, the design shop 
refused to pay us. According to them, we “did not meet the requirements as 
written.”
From that experience, I have learned the danger of poorly constructed, written requirements and how they can be used against you. It is important to 
always document your assumptions and insist on reviewing and signing off on 
requirements with the end-user, not just with a middleman.
Fortunately, agile project management practices have alleviated some of these 
issues. By recognizing the importance of nose-to-nose interfaces between the 
developer and the real customer, we have evolved to collectively creating User 
Stories, and prioritizing features based on the business value they will provide 
to the customer, rather than requirements lists. A one- or two-week iteration 
process means we have early and frequent feedback, and the opportunity to 
clarify customer expectations.
Twelve years later, I have run into almost exactly the same situation with a 
client who is highly concerned about vertical scrolling, even though he wants 
large amounts of content on the page. Luckily, with the way we run projects 
today and the lessons I learned from my past experience, we resolved this issue 
quickly and set realistic customer expectations without the chaos of the past.
