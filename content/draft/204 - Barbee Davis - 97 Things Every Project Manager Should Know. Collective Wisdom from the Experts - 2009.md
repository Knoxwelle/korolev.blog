178 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Increase Communication: 
Hold Frequent, 
Instant Meetings
Richard Sheridan
Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.
Software project managers often fall into the deadly trap of regularly scheduling their teams for painful meetings that have the unfortunate, 
unintended effect of actually decreasing communications. One of the all-time 
dreaded meetings is the classic Monday morning status meeting. As if Mondays weren’t bad enough already!
If you aren’t convinced that most meetings should be killed, try this experiment. As the software project manager, don’t show up. Ask one of your trusted 
colleagues about the meeting you skipped. Did they hold it without you?
If the meeting only happens when the boss or project manager shows up, kill 
it. Your team is telling you they don’t get value out of it. Never hold meetings 
where only one person gets value.
At my organization, we do everything we can to eliminate unproductive meetings and replace them with simpler communication paths among team members. For example, we have the team work all day, every day, in one big open 
room with no walls, offices, cubes, or doors. Thus, when I need an answer 
from someone, I can simply say, “Hey, James.” In less than 30 seconds, James 
and I have exchanged the necessary information and can get back to work 
without actually moving (or sending emails back and forth).
Imagine an all-company meeting with 60 people that is as easy to set up as 
shouting out “Hey, everybody!” Everyone stops what they are doing and 
responds, “Hey, Rich!” The meeting can take a few, short minutes and then 
everyone turns back to work without moving from his/her seat.

Our rituals and ceremonies include weekly “Show and Tells” to demonstrate progress on projects to sponsors, weekly “planning games” to authorize project scope, 
daily stand-up meetings, and weekly kick-off meetings to brainstorm about how 
we will work together toward common goals on client projects in the upcoming 
week. The meeting has a structure that makes participation easy and fun.
Try a daily stand-up meeting for one week and see if it catches on. Here are 
some lessons we’ve learned to make this meeting more effective:
•	 Invite everyone involved in the project. We often have 50–60 people in 
this meeting.
•	 Call the meeting with an alarm clock loud enough for everyone to hear. 
An impartial device calling the meeting is more likely to get participation. 
We use a dartboard that has an alarm clock in it.
•	 Use a speaking token. We use a plastic Viking helmet to control the meeting. Just hand it around the circle of people standing (no sitting allowed). 
The person who has the token has the floor.
•	 Have people report what they recently completed, what they are working 
on, and where they need help. Help doesn’t come during the meeting, but 
afterward.
Our typical stand-up meeting takes 13 minutes! Call it, assemble it, hold it, give 
everyone a chance to talk, finish it, and get back to work in 13 minutes. I defy 
most organizations to complete a useful meeting of 60 people in 13 minutes.
