180 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Flexibility Simplifies 
Project Management
Krishna Kadali, M. Tech

Miyamoto Musas hi, a famous 17th-century Samurai, believed in 
the principle, “Do not develop an attachment to any one weapon or any one 
school of fighting.” This advice also rings true in our project life. It is imperative that we not get too attached to any one management principle, software 
tool, or programming language as our only weapon. It is only through seeing 
our resources in a flexible way, arrangeable in many varying configurations, 
that we are able to prepare the best response to the customer problems that 
become our project.
Take an open-minded approach right from the beginning when you define 
your project requirements. If you already have your weapon and fight plan 
chosen before you talk to the customer, how can you be sure your solution is 
the best one?
Before picking your weapon, examine all your customer’s requirements. What 
problem is the customer trying to solve using your new software? The problems are usually attached to some business logic showing that the current 
resources aren’t feature- or function-rich enough. Next, consider the pool of 
existing factors and systems within your organization. Reusing parts of existing environmental systems skillfully can shorten and ease your project path.
Available enterprise environment factors include such diverse things as the 
company infrastructure of existing facilities, equipment and software, commercial and private databases, programming tools, and human resource skills.
A resource-oriented analysis of the customer requirements to be met by the 
software or other project deliverables will reveal some of these underlying 
resources that already exist in the organization: “Our users must be able to see 
the XPP34 call center system side by side with our corporate accounts receivable system. Your product will need to be merged, or be compatible, with our 
4465IL legacy software.”

Your job is to ask the right questions about various final performance results 
expected by the customer, and about how existing resources/software/systems 
and your new code ouput are to interrelate. You may be able to lay a foundation 
for changes your customer will want in the future using this resource-oriented 
approach. At the end of this analysis, your software begins to take shape as a 
set of new resources—things that not only solve today’s problems, but that can 
be used to complete future projects and interact with future software.
Once you know what the customer wants and what resources are already available within your organization, now you can choose your best weapon to fight 
the problem. Actual development can first focus on a few key requirements 
you deliver to gain the customer’s confidence. The modules and services 
needed for satisfying the key requirements should be implemented first.
Leaving your mind open to new paths for software design provides a pleasant 
way to handle software projects in the world of constantly changing requirements. This flexibility will simplify your project management challenges, and 
creating fresh weapons and plans keeps your workday interesting and enriching.
