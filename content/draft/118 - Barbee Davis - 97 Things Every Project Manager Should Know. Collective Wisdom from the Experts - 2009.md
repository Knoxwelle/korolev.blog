92 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
One Deliverable, 
One Person
Alan Greenblatt
Sudbury, Massachusetts, U.S.
Every deliverable should have a single person who is responsible 
for its completion. Everyone working on the project should clearly understand 
who is responsible for the delivery of each item. Actual development of the item 
may involve a large group of people, but ultimate responsibility for ensuring its 
on-time completion, and for understanding the technical issues surrounding 
that item, should be associated with one person.
Too often, especially in highly politicized environments, responsibilities are 
shared, particularly when things are a little fuzzy at the beginning of a project. 
People like to be responsible for highly visible items that they know are going 
to be successful. No one wants to be held responsible for something that is 
sure to be a failure. In the beginning of a project, sometimes responsibilities are 
shared because a deliverable, and its associated risks, are not fully understood. 
No one really wants to step up and assume responsibility for a vague task.
Sometimes, a deliverable is so juicy that you end up with multiple people who 
want to assume responsibility for it. Yet, not wanting to rock the boat, management doesn’t assign specific responsibility to one person for fear that others 
will get upset. Either way, you are setting the stage for much larger problems 
down the road.
First, if there is a problem associated with a deliverable, one individual who is 
ultimately responsible for it is much more apt to notify the team early, since 
she knows she will be held accountable. When time is tight, people have a tendency to assume that anything for which they are not held personally accountable will be handled by someone else. That is how things fall through the 
cracks. As software project manager, you end up with a crisis on your hands.

Second, as the project moves on, it is simply much more efficient for all team 
members, especially newcomers, to know exactly who to speak to regarding any 
issue. If you have a question, you want to make sure you are asking the right 
person—the expert associated with the topic at hand. And, if the expert doesn’t 
know the answer, he will get it for you. You shouldn’t have to spend your time 
chasing down an answer for something you don’t fully understand in the first 
place.
Finally, sometimes (all right, often), projects don’t turn out as expected. If people aren’t held accountable for their actions (or inactions), you’ll never be able 
to fix the problems that occur, and group dynamics will suffer. Few issues are 
more disruptive to team performance than the group wasting time trying to 
decide who to blame for failure of a “group” assignment.
You don’t want to turn this into a contentious means of assigning blame, but 
rather a means of properly distributing responsibility. And when a deliverable 
comes in early and under budget (or at least on time and within budget), it’s 
good to know who deserves the praise.
