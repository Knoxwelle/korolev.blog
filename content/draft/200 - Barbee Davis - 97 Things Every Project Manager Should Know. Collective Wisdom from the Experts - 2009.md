174 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Effectively Manage 
the Deliverables

Projects are comprised of a set of deliverables that, when completed, constitute the completion of the whole product, service, or result. For 
software development projects, integrating all of the components is crucial for 
the final result to work properly. The components, of course, vary depending 
on the kind of software you are building. So, the deliverables are the major 
components that should actively be planned, controlled, monitored, and managed by following these tips:
•	 Identify the deliverables. Identified deliverables outline the full solution, 
identify the order in which they should be created and delivered, identify 
metrics that should be used to monitor and control their development and 
delivery, and actively monitor their progress against the planned baseline 
and metrics defined.
It is very important to break deliverables into partial packets of code, each 
created to provide a special software function. This is especially important 
for complex projects/environments and projects developed by third parties. Do not wait to receive the full work package at the end. It is a good 
practice to arrange for the delivery of project parts bit by bit, and follow 
a preplanned process to deploy them to other members of the software 
team for use in their own development work.
•	 Monitor and control the deliverables. Once you have defined the means 
by which the work packages (functional code bits) will be built, monitored, and controlled, you must actively monitor and control the building 
phase to check whether the work is being done as planned. Checkpoints, 
metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs) should be shared with all 
project team members.

At the checkpoints, the KPIs and metrics should be evaluated against the 
baseline and trend analysis in order to identify variances. This way, corrective action can be done based on actual metrics, rather than hunches 
or hearsay.
•	 Manage the deliverables. Once the anticipated work is delivered, the 
code should be tested and deployed to a small group of users in order to 
verify that it complies with requirements before it can be considered finished. This approach helps identify problems so that corrective action can 
be taken before the software is deployed to the entire user group.
Throughout this approach, it is very important to remember that all minideliverables will be ready in phases and they should be tested in an integrated fashion (like a wave). If you wait until the full code set is delivered, 
you could receive a body of code with a lot of unknown errors/defects or 
unexpected behavior. Because the product/service/result was built with 
these issues, their effect is both buried and multiplied. The cost and the 
time spent in order to fix all nonworking code at this point can be very 
high.
You can balance and examine the vendor’s experience in your company’s 
environment, and in the system, against the complexity required by development and decide whether this approach should be good for you or not. 
In general, it is most useful for complex solutions or for new technology/
new solutions.
