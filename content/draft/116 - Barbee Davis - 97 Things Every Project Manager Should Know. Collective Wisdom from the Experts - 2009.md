90 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Don’t Throw 
Spreadsheets at 
People Issues

Have you ever been shown a spreadsheet with lists of activities 
to explain your work on a project? Many experienced managers try to use 
spreadsheet lists as a “silver bullet”*
 for managing and monitoring projects.
Tom is an information technology development architect in the online division 
of a large organization. He serves four or more different stakeholder groups. 
Since he has a poor ability to prioritize the deliverables for different stakeholders, he ends up annoying or disappointing someone every week. With too 
many commitments to fulfill, and too few resources on hand, he is always at 
the center of the resulting conflicts among the groups.
Tom and his team are talented IT architects, yet their lack of time and the skill 
sets necessary to manage stakeholder expectations creates problems for everyone in the online group. The solution? Get a trained software project manager 
to prioritize and list the deliverables for Tom and his team every week, month, 
or quarter.
The PM can facilitate discussions with the various stakeholders to prioritize 
the deliverables. Then, the priorities are evaluated across all the internal customers. This way, not only do the stakeholders have their expectations set correctly, but Tom and his team get a frequently refreshed list of tasks. They can 
stay focused on developing the most important items on that week’s agenda, 
across all projects.
The secret to making this plan effective is not to stop with a spreadsheet list 
of deliverables for each project. Instead, the PM sets the expectations of the 
* Silver bullet: In folklore, a silver bullet was the only kind of ammunition that would be effective in 
killing a werewolf, vampire, witch, or other variety of monster. Now, the metaphor can mean a new 
software or technology that will magically solve all major organizational problems. It can be any 
solution that is perceived to have far-reaching effectiveness.

stakeholders by involving them in prioritizing what features or functionalities 
are the most important/valuable/revenue-producing, given the amount of 
resources (time, money, and people) at Tom’s disposal. Then each group gets 
feedback regarding how much work it can expect that week, given the needs of 
other parts of the online division. Communication is the most effective component in planning out the work for Tom’s team, especially when the priorities 
of multiple projects must be established.
Perhaps Tom and his team have had an unfortunate experience with one of 
the stakeholder groups on a past project. With this approach, the “blacklisted” 
team can continue to get its work completed until time, or a more proactive 
intervention, helps heal the wounds from the previous interaction.
In the end, software project management is about managing people and managing the processes in which they are involved. Interpersonal conflicts within 
a team and between vying organizational groups are very common. Diversity 
in ideas, goals, values, beliefs, and needs are the primary strength of teams, not 
weaknesses. However, they inevitably lead to personal conflicts and conflicts 
over the prioritization of the workflow through the team.
Most conflicts are a threat to productivity and efficiency; resolving them satisfactorily can actually strengthen relationships, foster creative change, and 
improve results. All conflict resolution tactics depend on proactive communication, active listening, compassionate understanding, and some effective 
negotiation and/or arbitration. Skilled software project managers are needed—
because you can’t solve people issues with spreadsheets.
