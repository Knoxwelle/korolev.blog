134 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Clear Terms, Long 
Friendship!
Matteo Becchi, PMP

The title of this tip is from an old Italian saying: Patti chiari, 
amicizia lunga, which means “Clear terms equal long friendship.”
I think this mantra applies to many aspects of project management discipline. 
On a broader, methodological level, this saying summarizes in my mind the 
idea behind scope statements, setting goals and deliverables, and creating project definition documents. Really, all project artifacts are geared toward stating 
upfront the terms and goals the project team is setting out to accomplish.
Now take that concept to the 50,000 foot- (or 15,000-meter) view. Look at the 
initiation and planning phases of the project life cycle across the nine knowledge 
areas of the PMBOK® Guide, from developing the project charter, scope, work 
breakdown structure (WBS), schedule, cost estimates, to quality/HR/communication and procurement plans.
Each of these activities underlines the heavy focus we dedicate to planning 
upfront and communicating the plan to all stakeholders to make sure everyone is on the same page. These are basically measures to ensure smooth sailing 
on the journey that is the project life cycle.
Second, on the tactical level, when running meetings make sure you build, or 
simply state and set, clear project meeting guidelines and expectations with 
your team, such as:
•	 There will be a specific agenda and a required attendees list prepared 
ahead of time. With the high salary rates of good software developers, you 
can quickly go over budget if you waste coding time in meetings.
•	 Agree that each participant will prepare by gathering information, talking 
to outside experts, reading relevant publications or research, and consulting old notes or company records, as appropriate. A second meeting with 
expensive personnel because one teammate did not prepare is inexcusable.

•	 Arrive at meetings early if you need to plug in a laptop, set up projection 
equipment, or hook up audio devices for your part of the presentation. If 
not, come a few minutes early to find a chair, get coffee, and greet other 
team members.
•	 Set a “policy” of no communication devices during meetings (BlackBerries, 
laptops, and cell phones). If you’ve ever tried to speak while your technically adept software developers text or play games, you know that the 
programmers are tuning you out.
•	 Agree to respect other project team members by refraining from running sidebar conversations, interrupting, or talking over someone who is 
speaking.
Third, create clear contracts with your customers, vendors, and subcontractors. The sales division will focus only on the final product to be delivered and 
the final price your organization will receive. Be sure it also includes specifics 
of how changes will be requested and approved, and what the charge for them 
will be.
Try to set a process for how often and in what format the customer expects 
to be contacted regarding your project. Will your customers be available for 
questions? Will they be willing to provide end-users to test software features 
as the development progresses?
Clear terms equal long friendships—no matter where in the project environment you look.
