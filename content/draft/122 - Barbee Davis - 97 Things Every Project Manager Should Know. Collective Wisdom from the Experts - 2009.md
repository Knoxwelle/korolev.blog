96 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Build Teams to 
Run Marathons, 
Not Sprints
Naresh Jain
Malad, Mumbai, India
If you run at your fastest pace for a short period of time— a “sprint” in 
track and field terms—you burn yourself out. To run a marathon, a team must 
be disciplined, practice every day, and keep a sustainable pace. When working 
on software projects, we don’t want to run just once and exhaust ourselves. We 
need to keep going at a steady pace. Sustainable teams are geared toward running marathons and not allowed to just sprint.
Building useful software products is not an end in itself. Team members need 
to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true 
potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond their 
limitations.
Most teams have a gap in knowing how to do this. Someone needs to play an 
active role to fill this void. In most cases, the software project manager is the 
best choice to work on team development. I suggest the project manager target 
a goal to build sustainable teams. This is a primary way he/she can add extra 
value to the project.
If the project manager focuses on team building and individual growth, ontime and within-budget deliveries will automatically fall into place. This also 
ensures that teams are self-organized and don’t need a babysitter if the project 
manager needs to guide multiple projects simultaneously.
Typically, project managers get caught up in daily fire-fighting tasks. Hence, 
they don’t really have time to strategically build a team. Working with a longterm team development plan ultimately allows the project manager to keep 
out of micromanagement mode, not only for the current project, but on all 
future endeavors.

We need a fundamental shift in the focus of software project management 
practices so that the PM takes a more strategic role. Leave the tactical things 
to the programming team. This ensures that the team will take ownership of 
the project and the software project managers can become true facilitators or 
catalysts, making sure things are moving in the right direction for the project 
overall.
General George S. Patton said, “No plan survives contact with the enemy.” This 
means project managers need to spend more time empowering their teams to 
deal with unanticipated changes, rather than trying to get involved in day-today coding and architecture decisions. It’s foolish for them to think they can 
fool the information technology team into believing they grasp the intricacies 
of software development if they do not have a programming background. The 
team knows immediately that these project managers don’t know what they 
are talking about.
A software project manager is like an operating system’s kernel.*
 The kernel 
itself does not do end-user tasks, but it ensures that the end-user tasks are correctly completed by the applications sitting on top of it. Similarly, if a project 
manager can be a true facilitator and coach who ensures optimal collaboration 
among the team members, it should no longer be an issue to build self-organized 
teams ready to run marathons and deliver high-quality software.
* System kernel: The central component of an operating system. It manages the communication 
between hardware and software and connects the application software—such as Internet browsers, 
word processors, spreadsheets, and email—to the hardware of a computer. Memory, processing 
functions, and input/output devices can thus be used by all applications.
