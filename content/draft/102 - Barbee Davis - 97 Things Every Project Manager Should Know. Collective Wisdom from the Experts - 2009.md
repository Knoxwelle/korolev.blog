76 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Meetings Don’t 
Write Code
William J. Mills
Castro Valley, California, U.S.
Too often, people who could be doing something more productive are 
trapped in meetings—meetings that have wandered off their intended purpose, run over time, or trapped an entire team in the room when a more limited set of people would be just as effective. Only schedule meetings that have 
a specific purpose, and only include people on the invitation list who need to 
be there. Here’s an obvious list of things to avoid, as software project manager, 
when you are planning your team meetings:
•	 Chit-chat. If you have participants who use this time to have informal 
project-related exchanges, remind them to come a few minutes early or 
plan to spend time together after the meeting. You can’t afford for the 
entire group to wait until they finish chatting.
•	 Not getting in, getting done, and getting out. Plan a clear agenda that is 
distributed beforehand. If you assemble the entire team, be sure your topics are relevant to everyone.
•	 Diving too deep. It is good to bring up risk issues or roadblocks that have 
arisen. However, this is not the place to hammer out the solutions. Form 
smaller groups, or designate the appropriate team member, to pursue the 
issue after the meeting.
The minute software engineers start talking about specific implementation details, have them make a note to remain after the main meeting and 
move on with your scheduled agenda.

•	 Going off-topic. The current meeting has a specific purpose. Don’t lose 
that focus. There will be things that come up that are important, but not 
on topic. You may have too many nonessential people there, or you might 
be missing key stakeholders necessary to solve this issue. Schedule another 
meeting, or finish the current one and deal with the new issue at the end. 
Remember to let the folks who don’t need to be there get back to work.
•	 Going over time. As a project manager, you expect your team members 
to be able to estimate the amount of time it will take them to complete a 
specific task. It will be detrimental to the schedule if they go too far over 
the budgeted time in your meeting.
•	 Meeting too often. If you are following an agile methodology, quick daily 
meetings are necessary. If not, be sure the meetings you hold cover information or collect data that couldn’t be assembled in another way.
•	 Indulging long-winded participants. As the leader of the meeting, it is 
your job to use a nonverbal “stop” (hold up the palm of the hand toward 
the speaker) and smile. Say, “Your point is well taken, but in the interest of 
time, we are going to need to move on” (or “hear from others,” or “come 
back to this point later if there is time”).
As you are the leader on the project, team members may feel they can’t speak 
up about unproductive meetings. So, evaluate your own practices and see if 
you can improve them on your own.
