64 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Keep Your 
Perspective
James Graham, PMP
Ta’ l-Ibrag, Malta
When gathering business requirements from users, it is common 
to hear “the system is slow,” “the application is unreliable and crashes,” “it does 
everything we don’t need and nothing we do need,” “the menu structure is 
cumbersome,” and “it takes too many keystrokes to do a simple task.”
Most software project managers empathize with users. We try to make them 
feel better by suggesting solutions that will appear to remove their pain. I 
believe that this approach, while well intended, is intrinsically wrong. Further, 
it reduces the probability of a successful outcome in the subsequent project.
Some people say that the point of gathering business requirements is to provide a custom-designed solution, which in turn reduces end-user frustration. 
I would agree that this is a worthy goal. However, a fatal flaw occurs if the 
project manager who decides the best solution bases his decision on a heartfelt 
desire to make the users feel better. In reality, project managers may not have 
trained themselves to keep an unbiased perspective.
Perspective means looking for the best solution, not the fix that feels right to 
the users. Remember, users have a deep understanding of their business area 
and can make impressive contributions to a project by sharing that knowledge. 
But how should we use their input?
When I worked as a management consultant in London, my experienced colleagues used to mentor me on the importance of objectivity. Their wisdom 
was based on the truism that most experts like to show how clever they are,

when often they should spend more time using their skills to ask the right 
questions to uncover the root problem. If you don’t unmask the real problem, 
your attempts to remove it will only swat at the symptoms.
We all are at risk to succumb to this mistake. Recently, I was asked to design 
a management development program for a large organization. My immediate 
impulse was to rush to address its pain points speedily, by suggesting that we 
look at an existing program I own. I knew I could easily adapt it to cure the 
issues that were creating so much irritation for my client.
Fortunately, my self-restraint kicked in. I spent an hour talking to the senior 
managers about their real challenges. After I stepped back to listen to the business problem, not merely the end-user complaints that indicated something 
was amiss, I recommended an entirely different solution. It was more suited to 
their needs and addressed their core issues.
The next time you are confronted by frustrated users, take a deep breath. Allow 
them to vent their dissatisfaction with the surface symptoms they encounter 
day-to-day. These irritations are real. Then ask them a series of questions to 
get to the underlying, root causes of their frustration. Avoid the temptation 
to make them feel better by providing a quick fix. It is in their best interests 
for you to make sure you are aiming for the right target before you plan your 
project solution trajectory.
