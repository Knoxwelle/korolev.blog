72 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Work in Cycles
James Leigh

Our bodies are full of natura l cycles, and our productivity is no 
different. The human brain cannot focus on any single issue for more than a 
few hours at a time. Ideal workdays are designed to ensure that the body has 
time to rest and refocus every 90 to 180 minutes. Productivity has been shown 
to degrade after about 90–120 minutes of work, requiring the brain to change 
focus before productivity can increase.
The most effective software projects are created in environments that ensure 
that developers are mentally productive. However, many things that contribute to developers’ productivity are out of the control of their software project 
manager. You can’t ensure that they eat appropriately, or sleep enough hours at 
night. However, a project manager can help ensure that a developer’s productivity does not degrade during the day, by encouraging frequent breaks and 
providing opportunity for nutrition. The old saying that developers are driven 
by their stomachs is true.
Studies also show that projects are more successful when broken into iterations. By creating weekly or monthly subprojects—complete with goals, priorities, feedback, and releases—software bugs can be mitigated and developer 
satisfaction can be increased. Breaking the work into smaller iterations provides opportunities to track progress and acknowledge good results. It also 
gives everyone on the team the opportunity to reflect, give feedback to one 
another, and improve communication.

Every cycle should include a planning stage, an action stage, a completion 
stage, and a reward stage. Before beginning on any action item, ask yourself 
or your team these questions: why, when, how, what, and who? Why are we 
doing this? When is this going to be complete? How are we going to do this? 
What are we going to accomplish? Who on our team will be responsible for 
each portion of the item? With proper communication and understanding, 
the action stage can be effective and productive, contributing to the overall 
success of the project.
Once a task or action item is complete, get outside feedback. If one or two 
members of the team completed the work, get another team member to review 
it (peer review). If the entire team completed the work, get feedback from other 
stakeholders (preferably end-users). The final stage of any cycle is the reward 
stage; this is important for the sustainable health of any team or individual. As 
a battery must be recharged after use, the brain and body must be rewarded 
through recognition or acknowledgment of work.
As a software project manager, you must guide the team through project 
cycles, ensuring that every person understands the plan and gets the feedback 
he or she needs. Furthermore, each individual must follow his or her own daily 
cycle of planning, doing, completing, and being rewarded. The manager must 
ensure that all team members get the attention, information, and time they 
need to keep their productivity at its best. This way, you can ensure that your 
team is functioning at its full capacity.
