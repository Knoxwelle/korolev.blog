130 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Aggressively Promote 
Communication in 
Distributed Projects

Distributed projects create unusua l challenges since the project 
team members are not colocated (not physically together). As a result, the following issues can become impediments to the success of a project:
•	 Lack of trust between the geographically dispersed teams.
•	 Unwieldy amounts of time spent on communication.
•	 Inability to foster a “one-team” feeling due to cultural differences.
•	 Lack of participation from team members during common meetings.
•	 Lack of identity with the project team, as team members in different geographies may speak different languages and/or have different project practices.
These stumbling blocks have become nightmares for many software project 
managers facilitating distributed projects. Here are few to-dos to add to your 
communication arsenal if you are assigned to manage a distributed project:
•	 Find and document the overlap time between different geographically 
distributed teams (don’t forget Daylight Savings Time).
•	 Publish the instant messaging (IM) addresses of all the team members 
(and the best time to reach them).
•	 Make sure that each key stakeholder has all conference call access details 
(web and telephone).
•	 Gather and share the vacation details for different teams on a shared calendar.
•	 Publish a schedule of daily stand-up meeting between geographically dispersed teams. Stand-up meetings are better than sit-down ones; attendees 
focus because no one wants to stand for a long time.
•	 Publish the name and a headshot (photo) of each team member. Identify 
a back-up contact person for each key role.

•	 Set up a common location for sharing project artifacts among the teams 
(documents/reports/templates).
Besides enhancing your communication strategy, there are logistics issues that 
need to be addressed to promote superior communication among distributed 
teams:
•	 Invest in high-quality speakerphones for all locations. When participating 
in conference calls, assurances of stable phone connectivity between different teams will go a long way toward building camaraderie.
•	 Place the phone in a spacious room equipped with a large table, as you want 
to seat people comfortably and perhaps provide food for those participants 
meeting at unusual hours. Add whiteboards so notes from phone conversations can be jotted down quickly for everyone in the room to view.
•	 Budget funds for a few team members to travel to other team sites, perhaps 
during the initiation phase or quality assurance processes.
•	 Create a project dashboard (use any collaboration tool) for teams to communicate their issues. Share these dashboard images among the teams, 
whether they use online tools or only have the technology for digital 
photo sharing.
•	 Publish the overall goals and targets of the project at a common location 
for everyone to see, even telecommuters.
•	 Arrange presentations by business sponsors and insist that key team 
members from every location participate in these presentations.
As virtual and distributed teams become more common, you can increase 
your chances of success with innovative communication techniques.
