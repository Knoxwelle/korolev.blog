158 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Important, but 
Not Urgent
Alex Miller

The personal producti vity classic The 7 Habits of Highly Effective 
People, by Stephen Covey (Free Press), categorizes activities along a vertical 
axis, importance, and a horizontal axis, urgency. We now have four possible 
combinations:
1. Important and Urgent: Velociraptor*
 attack.
2. Important, but Not Urgent: Preparing future product strategy; reworking 
a problematic part of the product.
3. Not Important, but Urgent: Neighbor calling to borrow some sugar.
4. Not Important, and Not Urgent: YouTube; surfing the Web.
Let’s examine how to maximize our effectiveness.
Consider the Not Important, Not Urgent tasks (#4) first. Most of these activities (the ones you might categorize as “slacking off ”) can simply be dropped. 
These activities are, by definition, not important (so why are you doing them?) 
and not urgent (so they can surely wait). If category 4 activities are mandated 
by your company, you should be asking your boss why you must do them. 
Smart managers don’t want people doing unimportant work.
We should also strive to reduce the occurrence of Not Important, but Urgent 
activities (#3). One technique is to ask the source of the event to contact you 
in a way that lets you deal with the event at a time of your choosing. Another 
technique is to alter your environment to avoid being interrupted. Phone calls 
and email are often treated as urgent, regardless of their importance. Use voice 
mail or email filters to reduce the urgency of these tools.

Spielberg’s science fiction thriller Jurassic Park.

Important and Urgent activities (#1) generally must be handled as they occur. 
However, you should work to install systems (risk prevention) that address 
the cause of these events. For example, if bugs are causing a system to fail in 
production, you should analyze the cause of these bugs and institute quality 
controls to prevent them from occurring again. The best way to reduce the 
important and urgent events is to institute feedback loops that address the root 
cause of these occurrences.
The Important, but Not Urgent activities (#2) are the most important things 
you can do in your job. This is where you do knowledge work and produce 
value. If you did 25% more of these activities, your boss would give you a raise.
As a software project manager, you are in a unique position to focus the work 
of your entire team on the Important, but Not Urgent activities. Your job is to 
buffer your team from meaningless tasks (#4) and Urgent, but Not Important, 
requests from other teams (#3). You, as the manager, have the power to say no 
to these requests. Do them yourself, hire a lackey to do them, or just say no!
Your team can’t ignore Important and Urgent activities (#1), but if your team 
spends all its time fighting fires, then you need to fix the faulty wires causing 
those fires (#2). You might not see the benefits immediately, but over time your 
team will spend more and more time doing the Important, but Not Urgent, 
activities that make or break a project.
