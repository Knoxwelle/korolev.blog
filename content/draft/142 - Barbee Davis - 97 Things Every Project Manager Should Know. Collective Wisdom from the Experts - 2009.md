116 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Speed Is Life; 
More Is Better
Matt “Boom” Daniel
Coopersburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.
“Speed is life; More is better” is a common rallying cry in the jet-fighter 
community. Imagine the participants, and it is easy to hear, “Gotta go fast!” 
Right? “Everything must be done with immense speed!” Right? “Get there 
now, get away now!” Right?
There is no denying that in the daily flying life of fighter pilots, speed is a fundamental need. (Mav and Goose said so in the movie Top Gun, so it must be 
true.)
But is it always true that speed is life and more is better?
In a classic one-on-one dogfight*
 engagement, it is a viable tactic to go very 
slowly to minimize your turn radius. You turn in a circle with a smaller circumference, forcing your opponent to fly in a larger circle and end up in front 
of your aircraft so you have a better firing position. You “live inside his circle.” 
This is true control, as both aircraft are flying at the speed of a major league 
fastball while executing this choreography.
Scientific studies prove the advantage of optimal, rather than excessive, speed 
for specific moves, tactics, and delivery profiles. Optimal speed, not maximum 
speed, is the goal. So, once specific needs or tactics are chosen, speed is only a 
key metric. But more important is how you choose to use that energy (speed).
Venturing outside of the fighter-pilot world to that of business, does the first 
company to launch a new technology always win? If the goal is to have a survivable, relevant product or service, then the answer is, at best, “maybe.”
* Dogfight: In aviation history, a dogfight is a style of wartime aerial combat where two opposing 
forces engage in battles in the air. Emerging in World War I, dogfights between two planes were 
exchanges of gunfire and accompanying avoidance maneuvers.

Being the first to market (speed) may not matter at all in your organization’s 
business plan. The technology world is replete with examples of first-comers 
who washed out, or fell victim to too much focus on energy (speed), and not 
enough on energy management (applying that speed only when it served a 
business function):
•	 Communications satellites. Iridium (a global satellite-phone technology) was outsold by easier, cheaper communication systems that became 
more accessible to the average person.
•	 VCRs (Videocassette recorders). The Betamax recorder, developed 
before the Video Home System (VHS), was a superior product that was 
first to market. The technology became obsolete when the company 
refused to cross-license its products, services, and spin-offs.
•	 PDAs (Personal digital assistants). Apple Computer’s Apple Newton 
digital assistant, although early to market, was ultimately surpassed in 
sales by the interactive Palm phones.
•	 TV-to-Web. WebTV was an early, innovative product that used a television for a display rather than a computer monitor. It just never caught on.
Ask yourself, how do you as a software project manager balance speed to 
release with ensuring long-term relevance? What are the tools or practices you 
use to make sure that your new solution does not fall victim to obsolescence?
Do you have a “speed is life; more is better” focus? Is it a strength, or is it 
a weakness? In your environment, what does speed represent? What does 
energy management mean to your project team?
