136 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Best Estimators: 
Those Who Do 
the Work
Joe Zenevitch
New York, New York, U.S.
Have you been on a project where one person creates all the estimates 
for the work to be done? Has this been a successful approach? My guess is, 
probably not.
There are three major problems with this approach:
•	 Unless you are lucky, the developers on the team will not be at the same 
skill level as the person creating the estimates. So, while the estimates 
might be accurate if the lead architect were doing all the work, more than 
likely the developer’s pace will vary.
•	 The risk that one person estimating for the entire team will be incorrect is 
pretty high. The more people involved in estimating, the better.
•	 Developers are going to be handed an estimate they must meet. Rarely 
have I seen a developer who is happy with this approach.
The worst infraction is when you, as the software project manager, decide you 
are qualified to provide the estimates for the team. You may think that since 
you are a former developer you can adequately choose the estimates. Even if 
you are still actively doing development, think again. The same issues apply as 
with the lead architect scenario described above, but the longer it’s been since 
you’ve done active development, the worse your estimates are going to be. And 
don’t even think about estimating if you are leading a team using a technology 
with which you are unfamiliar.
On our projects, we do group estimation using a wideband-delphi approach. 
We start by having our business analyst describe the requirements for a feature, 
the development team listens, and then team members ask clarifying questions.

Once they are ready to give their initial estimate, they each write their individual figure on a card. When everyone has finished, on the count of three 
they all hold up their cards.
Now we see how they compare. If they are very close, we go with the more conservative number. If there is a wide discrepancy, we ask the developers to talk 
about the assumptions that went into their estimate. After more discussion, we 
ask them to estimate again. What happens most frequently is that the estimates 
converge to a single number as the developers gain a common understanding 
and agreement on what will be required to complete the feature.
This approach is advantageous because:
•	 All of the team is involved in coming up with the estimates and all varying 
perspectives are shared. Often team members are all of one mind and can 
get to a shared estimate quickly.
•	 Later, when actual coding begins, developers have all been exposed to the 
thought process that went into the estimates, making it less necessary that 
only certain people can work on any single feature.
•	 By having the team “own” the estimate, there is less chance of backlash. 
Their estimate may still be wrong, but team members will be less confrontational about it and more cooperative in coming to a revised estimate.
Remember, the best estimators are those who will do the work.
