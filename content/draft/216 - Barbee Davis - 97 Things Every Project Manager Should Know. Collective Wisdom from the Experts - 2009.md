190 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
True Success Comes 
with a Supporting 
Organization

If organizations avoid risk planning, aggressive problem seeking, 
and timely issue resolutions, it could be due to a problem with the culture. 
Those on a project team who play the devil’s advocate are often labeled as 
troublemakers. If the organization is quick to “shoot the messenger,” team 
members will avoid sharing troublesome issues and there may be an inclination to hide project problems.
This type of cultural setting encourages blaming behaviors that work to the 
detriment of the entire organization, individual employees, and the customers. The role of the software project manager is to provide a predictable project delivery, with as few unexpected events as possible. With no one pointing 
out pitfalls early, there are often “surprises.” Seldom are they good surprises, 
but rather, ugly ones showing that foresight and planning were impossible as 
developers hid issues from exposure.
Wise executives will make sure the company is supporting the attitudes and 
behaviors that allow developers to be effective. This includes evaluating human 
resource policies and incentive plans to make sure that they are aligned with 
behaviors that lead to the development of strong products and services.
A classic example of misalignment is an organization that officially “preaches” 
teamwork, but then consistently rewards individual contributions. People are 
smart; they know which path serves their own best interests. If upper management can establish consistency between what it professes to believe and what 
it provides as a work environment to encourage productive behavior, both the 
individuals and the organization can flourish.
For those of you who find yourselves in nonsupportive or dysfunctional organizations, here are some steps you can take:

•	 Ask and ask until you understand the scope of the project so you can work 
within it.
•	 Locate probable team members and other stakeholders. Whenever possible, include them in brainstorming, planning, and project execution.
•	 Allow the people who are doing the work to fully participate in project 
updates and decisions, at least until they finish their activities on this project.
•	 Always be an honest software project manager. Never gloss over or simplify problems to avoid conflict or uncomfortable discussions.
•	 Provide the environment within your project team that you’d like to see 
mirrored by the whole organization.
Project managers must be objective about the project. They occupy the unenviable role of owing their first allegiance to the organization that pays them, 
while at the same time needing to build a trust situation with the developers. 
If the project outlook looks bleak, an astute and principled project manager 
should make a recommendation that it be cancelled until peripheral problems 
can be addressed.
We all want to work in an organization with a cohesive strategy to support new 
software project development. But sadly, that capability level may vary enormously even among departments within a single organization. Since moving 
toward a more supportive environment benefits all, it should become a part 
of the software project manager’s role to alert upper management to cultural 
conflicts between project priorities and performance rewards.
