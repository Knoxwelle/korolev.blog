126 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Responding 
to a Crisis
James Graham, PMP
Ta’ l-Ibrag, Malta
At 3:03 p.m. on Januar y 15, 2009, Northwest Airlines Flight 1549 lifted off 
the runway at New York’s LaGuardia airport for the short flight to Charlotte, 
North Carolina.
The Airbus 320, commanded by Captain Chesley Sullenburger III, with 5 crew 
and 150 passengers onboard, encountered a flock of birds over Brooklyn, New 
York. Both engines suffered massive damage, causing a loss of thrust, or power.
Listening to the air-traffic audio tapes, two things stand out. First, one can 
almost hear Sullenburger’s brain working as he quickly realizes that the 
unthinkable has happened. His years of experience and training kick in. Second, one can hear the equally rapid reaction of the air-traffic controller as he 
continually suggests options to help, in a nonintrusive way.
Over the next few minutes, Sullenburger realizes that his aircraft does not have 
the potential to reach LaGuardia, Newark, or nearby Teterboro Airport safely, 
and decides to set down on the Hudson River. It must have been tempting to 
try to “stretch” the glide to terra firma, but this professional captain weighed 
the risks of all of his options and chose the one that saw all on board safe.
This is an excellent example of crisis management in action.
Passengers will be comforted to know that airline pilots discuss their actions 
before every important phase of flight and use checklists that are developed to 
help them manage both usual and unusual events. This means that they are 
clear on the vital actions they will take, as a team, during the flight.
This crisis required the crew to work as a team; while Sullenberger was flying 
the aircraft, First Officer Jeffrey Skyles was attempting to restart the engines to 
allow a runway landing, and the flight attendants were preparing the passengers to survive the ditching. Each member of the Northwest crew played his/
her part in ensuring a good outcome.

When thinking about your software project, consider whether the following 
conditions are true for your team:
•	 We have regular team briefings and increase the intensity of these before 
critical phases (e.g., testing).
•	 We have a risk register with appropriate responses identified.
•	 Our risk register is regularly updated and current.
•	 Our specialists on the team are trained to the appropriate level.
•	 We have a crisis management plan, with key responsibilities assigned.
•	 Our crisis management plan has a clear internal and external communications strategy/plan. 
If your answers are affirmative, great! You won’t have trouble sleeping at night. 
But if not, then some immediate thinking and planning would be sensible.
Establishing clear responsibilities for dealing with crises is a good start. That 
is a task that can be done in advance, as can the preparation of checklists, processes, and procedures for each critical project phase. These can be incorporated in the project management plan and its subsidiaries, and communicated 
so that all the team is clear.
Flight 1549 teaches that a capable team, with well-defined roles, can manage 
the most challenging crisis successfully.
