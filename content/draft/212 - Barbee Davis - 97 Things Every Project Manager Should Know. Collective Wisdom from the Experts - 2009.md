186 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
You Are Not 
in Control
Patrick Kua
London, UK
I remember one project team I coached. The project manager obviously had a desire to be the central point of control. He had what appeared to 
be an almost obsessive need to be involved in all “critical” decision-making 
discussions. He would actively direct the daily stand-up meeting, and he alone 
would decide who got to talk during project retrospective rituals. The team he 
managed was actually well formed by the time I arrived, and I noticed with 
interest how the quality of discussions differed between those where the project manager was present and those where he was not.
When I talked to a few people on the team one on one, they confessed they 
hated all of the meetings the project manager would hold, because they just 
wanted them to be over. They felt like their time was being wasted, as their real 
opinions were not valued. They recounted times they said the things the project manager wanted to hear to get him to move on. When they had issues that 
needed addressing, they would go to the technical lead. He was more willing 
to be part of an open discussion and, therefore, was more effective at solving 
problems.
The lesson I learned from this team is that acting as if you control the situation is not the same thing as actually being in control. In fact, actively seeking 
control sometimes creates the opposite effect. An experienced, well-formed 
team will actively shun a person trying to take control for personal reasons, 
especially if that control brings little benefit to the team.

It helps for project managers to understand group dynamics and different 
leadership styles. Different projects and various teams will require different levels of control. Well-formed, high-performing groups will often resent 
excess control unless they can see how it helps them.
The control will often be seen as “meddling” and though the groups may verbally agree, their actions after leaving the meeting may not fully reflect what 
you intended. However, with a newly formed team, more control may provide 
the group with direction and establish clearer objectives for the project.
Great project managers exert just the right level of control, respecting what 
skills, experiences, and connections team members bring to the project at 
hand. They recognize the signs when more control may help move the group 
toward its ultimate goal, as well as recognizing the signs when the same control may be slowing the group down.
Nowhere is this more crucial than when a non-IT project manager is asked 
to lead a software development project. The team, often resentful of outside 
interference in its workspace, may devalue the skill set the project manager 
brings to the project.
But the organizational skills, the ability of the project manager to keep the 
project in line with company goals, and the successful care of communication 
lines between upper management and the customer can protect the IT team 
and leave its members free to work.
