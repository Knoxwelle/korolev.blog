88 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Don’t Worship a 
Methodology

Many project managers get overly invested in following a methodology, which hinders their ability to manage the project to a useful, praiseworthy completion. If you used a certain format in your last job, studied it in 
school, or obtained a certification in it, you may feel tempted to rigorously 
establish all the processes and documents your textbook mentions, exactly as 
they are described. This is a dangerous pitfall and raises the following issues:
•	 Required level of effort. Working thoroughly through all the processes 
contained in reference materials may require a lot of administrative effort 
from every team member. Are you sure you have considered all those 
hours in your time and budget estimates? You certainly don’t want to put 
in place a fantastic set of procedures that document the fact that your 
project is failing because of the time you took to prepare them.
•	 Executing company’s culture. How familiar is your team with those specialized processes? Will you have to train team members? Is that training budgeted? Are they interested? What about functional managers and 
other company departments with which you will have to deal? Do your 
processes conflict with formally or informally established company processes and habits? Such conflicts could be a risk to the project.
•	 Project focus. The focus of the project manager must be the successful 
completion of the project, which in a software project is primarily linked 
to delivering the software. All the project management knowledge you have 
at your disposal is a means, not an end. Besides, your team will naturally

give importance to the same things you, as a project manager, give importance to. If your focus is the full establishment of, and compliance with, 
all the project management processes, that will be the focus of your team, 
too. And then who will create the software?
•	 Virtual or geographically distributed team. If all of your team members 
are not colocated, it may be very difficult to introduce and enforce mandatory procedures for them to follow. Their hardware and software, as well 
as other technology, may make compliance with your demands difficult, 
or even impossible. Narrow your expectations, if necessary, when having 
remote teams deliver the products or services you need from their small 
portion of the overall project.
In the end, no project management book or methodology you feel compelled 
to follow is more important than your good sense. You should go through a 
product analysis, a contract analysis, a first approach to a risk analysis, and an 
interview with your major stakeholders (client and sponsor), and then choose 
your project management strategy.
Try to document it for yourself, with a statement such as “I plan to manage 
the project this way because….” This will help you adjust your strategy in case 
the root reasons for your decision change. Based on the needs of the project, 
you can determine which processes are most important and should be implemented thoroughly, and which processes might deserve a lighter approach. 
In the end, a good project management plan is all about being effective and 
keeping it simple.
