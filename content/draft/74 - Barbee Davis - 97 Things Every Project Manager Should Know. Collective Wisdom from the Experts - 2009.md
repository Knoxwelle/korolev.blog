48 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know

As software project managers, we obsess over the schedule details. 
We huddle with our teammates to try to anticipate risk factors that could 
derail our projects. We crunch numbers to see if we can squeeze the project 
deliverables out of the allocated budget. But we tend to overlook, or ignore, the 
most prevalent cause of project failure: the human factor.
From errors, to accidents, to out-and-out nonperformance, human failure to 
perform can often be tied to our tendency to repeat our past behaviors. If it 
worked successfully for us last time, it should work again. There is an old saying: “For he who is a hammer, every problem is a nail.” Psychological research 
shows that people under the influence of stress may revert to the learning or 
experiences that are hammer-like, because they found success with them in 
the past. What is more stressful than undertaking a new software project?
Because the objective of most projects is to create a new product, service, or solution, agility and flexibility of mind and working style are major positive behaviors to encourage instead of repeating past actions. Following old processes may 
be counterproductive when you’re faced with a new, different challenge.
Consider a business analyst who is highly experienced in one formal software 
project management methodology. Intellectually, he may agree with his developers’ explanation of why a more agile approach to software development 
makes sense. But when faced with time pressures that appear to compromise 
the project, he may revert to using some favorite techniques that worked well 
in past, non-software-related experiences.

Bank supervisors report that reversing numbers is a common error, especially when employees are not 100% focused due to work-related or personal 
stress. Knowing this human tendency, the wise project manager will carefully 
check estimates, budgets, and other documents for these types of careless, but 
human, errors.
What leads to stress on your project team? It could be personal, such as having 
an argument with a spouse before leaving for work, or financial pressures at 
home. Perhaps there are family worries about health or children.
Work-related encounters can also be stress inducing. It could be something 
as minor as being late to a key stakeholder meeting and forgetting to bring an 
important document. Or, it could be concerns from job security to worries 
that the coding and testing for this project cannot be completed on target.
Stress leads to past behavior, not active problem-solving actions. As the software project manager, it is your job to be on the lookout for symptoms of stress 
that can lead your team members to regress to old behaviors. By having active 
conversations with them and carefully managing their work environment, you 
can prevent or help minimize the effects of stress.
People are human, so human emotions are natural in the workplace. But only 
people can develop software. So, nurture and manage your human capital as 
carefully as you monitor and protect your nonhuman resources.
