118 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Building the Morale 
on Your Team
David Bock

A major role for the software project manager is to create a 
work environment that fosters the growth of team morale. Here are some tips 
to help you start that process:
•	 Give your team some control over the direction of the project. Do you 
talk with your team frequently? Do you regularly seek out its input? Can 
someone make a suggestion, or bring a complaint to you, and feel like you 
will actively work to effect a change because of it?
•	 Defend your team against “the bureaucracy.” Every organization has its 
share of rules, and one of your jobs is to apply them in context. “In context” means that, when appropriate, you will defend your team.
When a corporate memo comes out with rules banning cubicle decorations, will you argue with management so Bill can keep his Rubik’s cube 
collection on display? Even if you lose, the team’s morale will benefit.
•	 Look for ways to improve the work environment. I knew an engineer 
who worked in a cubicle next to a window. But, according to the company organizational chart, he didn’t warrant a window office. Corporate 
solution? The cubicles were reconfigured so that the window in his workspace was blocked. Rather than argue with the “furniture police,” a good 
manager would be the first person to start moving those cubicle walls to 
uncover that window.
•	 Make your team feel like a team. One team had a Player of the Week award 
that changed hands at the team meeting each week. Russ might say, “I’m 
giving Mary the team player award because she worked late Thursday 
night. I was late getting her the documentation, but thanks to her efforts, 
we still finished the iteration Friday morning.” The next week, Mary would 
recognize another team member’s contribution and pass along the award.

•	 Respect the work-life balance. It is all right to demand overtime from 
people occasionally, but if you are going to take time from their lives, you 
need to give some back. Your employees shouldn’t be afraid to schedule a 
morning doctor’s appointment or attend a child’s afternoon recital, especially after they’ve worked late to meet a deadline.
•	 Understand how cause and effect shapes morale. When you merely try to 
recreate what motivated you or others on past teams, you may be missing 
the key elements. If you ask yourself, “What can I do to improve working 
conditions of my team?” and actually work to make those changes, morale 
will usually improve.
•	 Make sure your activities are visible. You are a team member, too, so the 
team should be aware of the work you are doing for it. It is easy to distrust 
a manager who is always behind a closed door, and easy to follow one who 
is openly, visibly working for the good of the team.
In your organization there will be unique opportunities to improve morale. 
Consciously look for them and take advantage of them. If they work, share 
them with others.
