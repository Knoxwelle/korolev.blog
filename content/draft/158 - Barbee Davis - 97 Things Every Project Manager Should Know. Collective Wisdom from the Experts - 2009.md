132 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Start with the 
End in Mind

Congratulations! You’re the project manager of that dream software project that everyone wanted to manage. All the company’s expectations are placed 
on your shoulders. Your instinct tells you to run to your desk and start drafting the project schedule, right? Well, there are a number of things to do first 
to increase the chances of delivering a successful project. One of those things 
would be “start with the end in mind.”
First, take the statement of work (SOW), the contract, or any documentation 
that would tell you what the customer wants and needs. Find the difference 
between “wants” and “needs” (I want an SUV, but what I need is a smaller 
vehicle with good gas mileage). Now you’re in a better position to combine 
both and answer questions like “what are we trying to accomplish?”, “what 
would make this project a success for the customer, my company, and for me?”, 
and “what would it take to achieve that success?”
There’s a lot more to the answer of this last question than just “a reasonable 
profit.” You want the customer to come back to you, you want the project team 
members to want to work with you again, and you want to become the beacon 
of reference-ability.
The right attitude and the right people-management skills are paramount to 
your success as a project manager. Call a kick-off meeting with your project 
team members and review the SOW to gain a common understanding of what 
you must deliver.

Next, define the scope of the project and create the work breakdown structure. 
Identify the quality parameters you must satisfy. Develop the schedule. Figure 
out how much money you will need. These elements (scope, quality, duration, 
and cost) will be the basic ones you should monitor and control, and are the 
cornerstones of your project plan.
Once you break down your project into manageable pieces, you must identify 
what characteristics the final product must have to satisfy the project’s quality 
requirements. After you have properly sized your project (scope) and noted 
what “rules” must be complied with (quality), you will be in a better position 
to determine how long it will take you to finish it.
To find out how much time you will need to complete the project, you need to 
determine the duration of each individual task, the dependencies among each 
of those tasks, the specific constraints, and the resources available to you. Cost 
comes last in this, since it is usually a function of the work you need to do, and 
the time and resources you will need to complete that work. For example, if 
you hire a consultant to perform a specific task, it will not cost you the same 
amount if that individual is scheduled to work for one week than it will if he or 
she will be working on your project for, let’s say, 10 months. Finally, consider 
procurement, communications, and human resources.
By starting with the end in mind, you have a much better chance to be successful.
