58 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Value Results, 
Not Just Effort
Venkat Subramaniam
Broomfield, Colorado, U.S.
Developing software takes a lot of effort . However, if you hear 
someone brag, “I work on an application with over 3 million lines of code,” ask 
him or her how many of those lines of code are really needed.
Often, extra code is added with some perceived extensibility*
 in mind. Extensibility is important, but if not done correctly, it can have the opposite effect. It 
can delay your current project.
Extra, out-of-scope code is a symptom of software project managers who 
reward only extra time and extra effort. If you routinely insist that the programmers work long hours, be sure they are actually producing additional, 
useable results.
I like my lawn to be green, and rely on my sprinkler system to water it every 
day. My first summer in Colorado, I noticed that one of my maple trees had 
lost most of its leaves. Assuming that the hot and arid conditions were the 
reason, I watered longer but noticed no improvement. The expert I consulted 
asked me, “How frequently and how long do you water?” Hearing my answer, 
he said, “That’s the problem! Reduce the duration and frequency by half, and 
you will see improvement.”
I was killing the tree with excessive water. Having slightly less water actually 
helps these trees. It builds their resistance and helps their growth. Two weeks 
after following his advice, my tree was healthy and full of leaves.
Your programmers are like maple trees when it comes to work time. Give them 
small, but adequate amounts of time and fewer broadly defined tasks, and they 
flourish. Give them larger task chunks and ask them to routinely work extra

hours, and they begin to wilt. Plus, they tend to overwrite and complicate the 
code, since they have too much time on their hands.
I worked for a manager who focused on how long people worked. Working a 
Saturday morning, or staying late in the evening, was more important to him 
than what employees were actually producing. It is impossible to be a productive and effective programmer for 12 hours or more a day.
In another group, the manager kept us to a traditional eight-hour work schedule. 
Yes, there were days we stayed late, but those were exceptions rather than the 
norm. Employees knew they were not required to work long hours but had to 
provide their committed deliverables on schedule. So, we were focused and less 
distracted, prioritized our work well, and used our time effectively. Even though 
developer capabilities were about the same in both groups, we got more accomplished in the second group than in the one where we worked to exhaustion.
Encourage programmers to report the progress they make, rather than how 
long they work. Let them know that you care about getting results rather than 
keeping track of how long they spent at the computer. Once your team members realize that you are a results-oriented manager and not a “put in hours” 
manager, their focus will shift to achieving results rather than merely clocking 
hours at work.
