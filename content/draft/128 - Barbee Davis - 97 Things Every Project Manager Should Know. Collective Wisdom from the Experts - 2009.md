102 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Importance 
of the Project 
Scope Statement
Kim Heldman, PMP

If the project plan is the heartbeat of a solid project management 
methodology, the scope statement is the breath. The scope statement details 
the vision of the project. It describes the goals and deliverables, and documents what a successful conclusion to the project looks like.
Unfortunately, many stakeholders have little interest in going through the 
exercise of writing a scope statement. Even further, while most project managers do take the time to create a well-rounded scope statement, they often 
archive it before the signatures are dry and never look at it again. It’s important to keep checking back with the scope statement throughout the project to 
make certain you’re delivering what the customer is expecting.
One of my favorite analogies, and I use it often with my customer base, is 
the remodel story. Imagine you have hired a contractor to finish the basement. The question is, do you give the contractor direction or do you let him 
decide what the layout will look like? Sure, the contractor will likely have some 
ideas on layout, how big the rooms should be, and where the plumbing already 
exists. But what if you want two bedrooms, a three-quarter bath, and a game 
room, but the contractor builds one bedroom, a full bath, and a family room 
with a full bar? Not at all close to what you were thinking.
And therein lies the importance of the scope statement. It is the project blueprint. It describes the characteristics of the finished product or service of the 
project. Without it, you might build one bedroom when your stakeholder is

expecting two. The scope statement helps you manage stakeholder expectations. More than once, I have been knee-deep in the project life cycle, usually after a few key deliverables are in prototype stage, and had a stakeholder 
say, “I thought we were getting two bedrooms.” This is where the scope statement comes to the rescue. You certainly don’t want to wield it as though it is 
a weapon, but it is a great way to gently remind your stakeholders what they 
agreed to back at the beginning of the project.
It’s a good idea to periodically review your scope statement with your stakeholders. Project status meetings or steering committee meetings are a logical 
place to conduct this review. Devote some time every other meeting, or at 
intervals that make sense given the size and scope of your project, to reviewing 
the deliverables listed in the scope statement.
If you’re conducting regular status meetings, you’re likely doing this to some 
extent already. Status meetings typically address the work accomplished last 
period, and the anticipated work to be completed during the next work period. 
Occasionally take the time to go beyond the next work period and remind everyone of the key deliverables that are scheduled to be delivered later in the project.
Regularly reviewing the project scope statement can increase your chances for 
a successful project and keep your stakeholder’s expectations aligned with the 
goals of the project.
