152 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Project Sponsors—
Good, Bad, and 
Ugly
Jorge Gelabert, PMP
Berlin, Connecticut, U.S.
Every project needs a sponsor—usually the person who initiated the 
project and is responsible for providing the financial resources to successfully 
complete it. Typically, this is someone high in the organization who will champion the project and step in when the software project manager faces company 
challenges beyond his control. The larger the project, the greater the importance of a strong sponsor.
In my experience, sponsors come in three flavors: good, bad, and ugly. It is 
important to recognize each type and know how to deal with it.
The worst type of sponsorship is “ugly.” These sponsors are usually assigned. 
Therefore, they have no personal investment in what the project is delivering 
or its intended use. Such a sponsor tends not to listen to the project manager 
and instead focuses on arbitrary due dates set by those who have assigned 
him/her to the project. Benign neglect is common. Assigned project sponsors 
may change frequently, so there is no continuity.
Spotting this type of sponsorship is easy; addressing the problem is not. The 
software project manager must work with the sponsor and respond to his/her 
desires. Often this is at odds with making the project successful. One answer 
can be to find a surrogate sponsor, a person or group who will benefit from the 
deliverables of the project and who may be able to provide the assistance typically provided by a sponsor. Alternately, the project manager can ask others 
with influence to intervene on their behalf with the current sponsor. Your success will depend heavily on how well you, the project manager, are networked 
within the organization.

The “bad” sponsor can hinder a project in different ways. He or she may 
become involved in routine matters typically handled by the project manager, 
interact directly with team members, and make inappropriate project decisions—usurping the role of project manager and confusing the team. He/she 
may be a weak sponsor, fail to provide needed resources, become overburdened 
with other efforts, or not have time to provide guidance for the project.
Prevent “bad” sponsor problems by developing clearly defined sponsor roles 
and responsibilities up front. In the case of the intrusive sponsors, providing 
them a “job description” of their role may get them to modify their behavior. 
With weak sponsors, knowing what is expected may make them realize they 
can’t fulfill that role, and you may get a better sponsor assigned to the project.
The ideal situation is having a “good” sponsor. Good sponsors understand 
their role and responsibilities and behave accordingly. These are the project 
champions who provide resources, assist when needed, and support the project manager in his/her decisions. It’s a company executive who is personally 
invested in the project success.
Whether “good,” “bad,” or “ugly,” it is your responsibility as software project 
manager to manage the sponsor, just as you manage the project. Keep the 
sponsor well informed, involve him/her only when necessary, and avoid allowing the sponsor to take control of the project. Learn to recognize the sponsor 
types and prepare accordingly.
