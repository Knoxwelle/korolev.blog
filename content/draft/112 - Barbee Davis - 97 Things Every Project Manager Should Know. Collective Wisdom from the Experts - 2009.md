86 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Introduce a More 
Agile Communication 
System

Most retrospectives of failed projects place a great deal of blame 
on communication breakdowns between software project managers, team 
members, and stakeholders. Project managers are taught to mitigate communication breakdowns between team members, and provide constant, effective 
communication. The weight of this responsibility sometimes leads project 
managers to overreact. They blur the line between essential, concrete communications and those where the content‐to‐noise ratio actually harms project 
progress instead of helping it.
To solve this problem, many software development endeavors are moving 
toward a more flexible, agile process. The key to agile methodologies is timely 
communication loops that enable agile teams to respond effectively to unforeseen changes, and quickly reassess and reprioritize project features.
How do agile project managers keep communications limited to the essentials? They promote the daily “15-minute stand‐up” meeting. It entails developers describing what they’ve accomplished since the last standup, what 
they’re planning to accomplish “today,” and any impediments they foresee in 
reaching their goals. The negative risk of a stand‐up meeting is that it may 
rely solely on the precision of each developer’s self-assessment. The solution? 
To make stand‐up meetings more effective, integrate a task management tool 
that can show the output of a feature’s tests. A tool does not lie about the state 
of a project’s codebase, and testing results are a valuable addition to developer 
self-assessment. Presenting report data correlating a feature to a set of tests it 
passed gives a more accurate representation of the state of the feature.
For example, results from a continuous integration tool can paint an objective picture of progress. This reduces the stand‐up meeting communication to 
the essentials: reporting of impediments (hopefully, already caught by the task 
management tool) and unforeseen developments due to edge cases, integration

challenges, and bugs/defects. By reflecting these development “discoveries” 
through a shared, globally accessible tool, developers gain a greater level of 
feedback precision. Often, unseen connections between features and tasks can 
be discovered early.
One typical misconception is that synchronous*
 communications are always 
more effective than asynchronous†
 communications. Adding development 
tools and short, asynchronous communication loops can effectively supplement face‐to‐face communications.
At a more general level of feedback, a wiki system can easily keep the vision 
of the project adjusted to the reality of the development progress. Such a system can also make information available in a timely manner and provide a 
higher‐level channel to communicate to stakeholders-at-large, who might not 
be interested in the deep, technical details impeding a particular feature’s progress. By contrast, a software developer’s vision of the overall project can be 
blurred over time by the minutiae of his daily technical work. A wiki is an effective way to keep a clear, shared vision of the project among all the participants.
By attacking the problem of keeping information loops tight and noise-free, 
software project managers can help avoid the breakdown in communications 
typically blamed for project failures. A project manager’s responsibility and 
challenge is to streamline the feedback loops at every level of a project.
* Synchronous communication: Participants all participate at the same time, whether in person or by 
virtual means.
† Asynchronous communication: Participants have access to information, but do not have to be physically present and available in real time. Examples include email, discussion boards, and shared folders.
