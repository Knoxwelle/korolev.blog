154 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Should You 
Under-Promise, 
or Over-Deliver?
Joe Zenevitch
New York, New York, U.S.
At the end of the project, deliver less than you said you would, and you 
are a bad software project manager. Deliver more than you said you would, 
and you’re the hero. Actually, you should strive to deliver exactly what you 
promised. No more, no less.
New project managers, eager to please, let business people/customers continue to add features, even as the team’s capacity to deliver them shrinks. The 
business people, thinking that the project manager has things under control, 
take advantage of this opening, and the onslaught of new features continues.
Afraid to show weakness, the green PMs just sweat it out and hope they can 
deliver. But as the project end date draws near, it may become obvious that the 
features list will not be finished. The process of cutting features, not necessarily the newest additions, grudgingly begins. The formerly happy business 
people are now planning the termination, or at least the post-release punishment, of the project manager.
The experienced PMs know that they are going to have to be firm from day 
one. Anything that resembles a new feature, or a change in scope, will be met 
with pushback from the PM. He/she reminds the business owners that only so 
many features will fit into each release.*
 If something new comes up, it must be 
deferred to a future release or substituted for a planned feature.
The experienced PM avoids “High–Medium–Low” categorizations, as customers may mark everything a “High.” They prefer a prioritized list of features 
based on business value. A good PM reminds the business owners that features 
* Release: At the end of a predefined work period, one or more iterations, the goal is to have the 
feature(s)—working code—of the software available for demonstration to the customer, or perhaps 
for actual use by a limited user group. This delivery of completed features is called a release in agile 
programming.

at the bottom of the priority list may not get done this release if delays are 
encountered. These rules serve as an annoyance to the business owners, especially those who haven’t learned that ramming in features won’t work. Over 
time, they get used to the process and come to accept it as a fact of project life.
Of course, the experienced PM expects that changes are going to happen during the course of the project, and has built contingency time into the plan. 
This contingency is held close to the vest, sometimes not being revealed to the 
customer or even the team. It is managed like a precious resource, and only 
features that survive the pushback battle get to eat into it.
When this does happen, the business owner is usually thankful that the PM 
finally obliged him. In the final days of development, if contingency remains, 
the PM might even opt to “open the reserves” and produce a few extra features. 
Some business owners might question why they couldn’t have them earlier, but 
in most cases they are happy to receive a few extra, unexpected things.
Now the PM stands at the end of the release. The team has delivered on what it 
said it would. Sometimes it has provided extras. The business owner is happy, 
the team is happy, and the PM’s reputation is intact. Let the end-of-release festivities begin.
