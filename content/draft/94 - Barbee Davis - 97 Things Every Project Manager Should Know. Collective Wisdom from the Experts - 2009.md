68 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The 60/60 Rule
David Wood
Fredericksburg, Virginia, U.S.
We often pretend that software development is the most important part 
of the software life cycle. Methodologies abound for development. Books, 
magazine articles, and blogs focus on development. Development, however, is 
just not where the money is.
Fully 60% of the life cycle costs of software systems come from maintenance, 
with a relatively measly 40% coming from development. That is an average, of 
course. The actual cost of maintenance may vary from 40% to 80%, depending 
on the system type and the environment it is deployed into. During maintenance, 60% of the costs on average relate to user-generated enhancements 
(changing requirements), 23% to migration activities, and 17% to bug fixes.
The 60% of life cycle costs related to maintenance, coupled with the fact that 
60% of maintenance activities relate to enhancements, gives us the so-called 
60/60 Rule, one of the few proposed “laws” of software maintenance.
Migration activities include moving systems to new hardware or software environments. Migration is, of course, a type of changing requirement. Factoring 
that into our estimates points out an interesting fact: over 80% of maintenance 
activities relate in some way to changing requirements.
Naturally, the ability to change code suggests that one should understand it 
first. Understanding changes to be made is a major activity during maintenance. Roughly 30% of total maintenance time is spent on understanding an 
existing software product. The development of understanding applies to all 
forms of maintenance: changing requirements, migration, and bug fixes.

Understanding is a cost we must pay to maintain code that someone else wrote, 
or we wrote long enough ago that we no longer have an intimate knowledge 
of it. During maintenance, understanding code takes the place of new design 
work found during development for most tasks.
The 60/60 Rule should prompt us to rethink the focus of software development, as well as maintenance. The tendency to address development activities 
may not yield the most impressive gains. Boehm’s early assertion in the early 
1980s that proper software engineering discipline can reduce defects by up 
to 75% may be true (although I seriously doubt it), and became the basis for 
much work toward development methodologies, but so what?
A good methodology may reduce bugs (17% of the total maintenance effort), but 
not address migration, enhancement time, or cost at all. To reduce maintenance 
costs, we have to address the costs associated with understanding code, adjusting code to new requirements, and/or migrating code to new environments.
The 60/60 Rule suggests that we should focus our efforts on creating systems that 
are maintainable. Our software must be designed to change so systems become 
flexible in the face of new requirements. Designing such systems is one of the 
next great challenges in software engineering.
We know at least part of the answer. The software components need to become 
less tightly coupled with one another, much the way the components of the 
World Wide Web are bound together at the last possible moment and in a 
flexible manner.
