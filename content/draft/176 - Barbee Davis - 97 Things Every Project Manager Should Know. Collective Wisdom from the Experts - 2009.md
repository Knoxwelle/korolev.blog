150 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Buying 
Ready-Made 
Software

Currently, it is very common and useful to buy software that is readymade—ready to be tested, implemented, and used out of the box. Why? Such 
software allows organizations to leverage their efficiency and optimize their 
effectiveness by cutting time spent in the developmental and implementation 
phases. In this kind of purchase, you are not only buying the software, but the 
know-how of the company that wrote the software.
Of course, each organization has its own procedures, policies, and legacy software (e.g., accounting systems, security software, etc.). Therefore, new software 
often has to be customized in order to support the company policies and procedures, and to integrate the programs with previously installed legacy systems. 
In many cases, the vendor will capture the knowledge for that customization 
during the presales process.
This is the point where the major problems may arise. Even if you follow a very 
detailed procurement process, it is very complicated to determine whether certain functionalities (e.g., formulas, data entry screens, integration with legacy 
software, etc.) inherent in the new application will work as business/product 
area requirements intended. Once the procurement process is complete, the 
contract is signed, and the project plan is approved and in implementation, 
issues can pop up during the testing phase. The troubles can be related to the 
customization or, in the worst-case scenario, related to the functionality that 
the software was assumed to have based on the demo.
It is very important to follow specific steps before the contract is signed:
1. Prepare a very detailed checklist regarding the company’s software needs.
2. Visit the company and prepare a due diligence report.

3. Prepare a vendor evaluation report, test cases, and test plan.
4. Make sure the test case is completed and documented.
5. Follow the test plan/cases before the contract is signed.
The gaps, and the plan by which these gaps will be bridged, should be understood and approved by both companies. After this process is carefully followed 
and documented, you will have very clear information by which to determine 
which software should be purchased, the estimated time required for software 
customization, and the actual associated costs. You will save money and time 
in the long run.
It sounds as if a lot of time will be spent before the vendor is selected and the 
contract is signed. Yes, but it is better to invest this time rather than waiting 
until the software is in your hands to be installed. If too many incompatibilities 
are discovered during testing—or, worst-case scenario, after the software is 
already deployed to the final user—costs will skyrocket.
To recap, when your company decides to buy ready-made software, spend 
more time identifying the real need and researching the functional and technical details of the software chosen before purchasing. Use this approach whether 
the software provider is well known or new to you, and whether the software 
is a low-impact desktop application or a more crucial server-side application 
that could bring the company to its knees.
