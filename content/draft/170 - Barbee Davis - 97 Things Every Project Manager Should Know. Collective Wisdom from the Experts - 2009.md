144 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Documents Are a 
Means, Not an End
Patrick Kua
London, UK
Eisenhower once said, “Plans are wort hless . Planning is essential.” Successful project managers understand how to reap the benefits from 
planning without the overhead of meticulously updating their plans in minute 
detail. They actively use documents to help spark meaningful conversations, 
not as the replacement for all communication methods, or worse yet, as a way 
of pointing out when people breach an agreement.
Planning and tracking will remain essential activities for a project manager, 
though always framed in the context of achieving a particular goal. Many 
organizations (incorrectly) measure project managers on how well they stick 
to a plan, or how thoroughly a particular set of documents has been completed, distributed, and archived.
In organizations that misunderstand planning, project managers are asked, 
“How accurately did you meet the plan?” Beware of enterprises that ask this 
micromanagement-centered question instead of the more important question, “Did you deliver the most value in the desired timeframe?” Value may be 
judged as achieving the right goal within a given budget, delighting customers, 
or exceeding expectations. With the wrong yardstick in hand, sometimes it’s 
all too easy to forget what the end goal truly is intended to be.
Focusing on just developing plans and the perfect set of documents creates 
a false sense of progress and accomplishment. It implies that the execution 
of the plan is the easy part and that the plans are accurate, both of which are 
hardly ever the case.

I have seen project managers try to force everyone participating in the project 
to keep to the activities and schedule recorded in the original plan. They fail to 
realize that, as they recognize changing conditions, it would be more useful to 
lead the team in replanning activities based on the new circumstances.
Plans and documents contain essential information for a business to meet its 
goals. However, the plans and documents by themselves are actually quite useless. They need people to act upon the results they highlight and for someone 
to convey the information they contain to other parties who would then benefit from the knowledge.
Therefore, it is always important to consider what is the right level of information to be passed on and what is the best method for delivering the information 
to other parties concerned with the outcome of this project. Documents are 
often the poorest choices to convey important data. The richest level of communication is face-to-face.
Project managers also have the unenviable job of maintaining the delicate balance between the overhead need to meet traceability or auditing requirements 
and other non-document-centric activities that ultimately add value to a project.
Successful project managers do just enough planning, capture just enough 
detail, realize that issues will invariably arise as the project progresses, and 
recognize when plans need to change because of new or unanticipated needs. 
They remember that the documents from the planning process are the means 
to a well-run project, not an end in and of themselves.
