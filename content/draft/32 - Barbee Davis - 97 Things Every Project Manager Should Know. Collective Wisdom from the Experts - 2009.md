6 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
A Word Can 
Make You Miss 
Your Deadline
Pavel Simsa, PMP
Bellevue, Washington, U.S.
Which word can make you miss your deadline? The answer is “any 
word.” When you are developing a product that will be released in languages 
other than English, you are adding numerous new risks and constraints to 
your project.
Some are technical and obvious. For example, if your product will be released 
in Japanese, it has to support the appropriate fonts. If it doesn’t, the Japanese 
version won’t work, even if the English one works perfectly. But font compatibility is not under your control. You and your team need to be aware of translation quirks and consider them before coding. Make sure that the development 
practices follow international standards that will eliminate such issues.
However, the mere need for alternate language versions also constrains what 
decisions you can make and when. Typically, localization (Japanese, Swedish, 
German, etc.) happens in parallel with English development, with a certain 
lag. It can be a few days, weeks, or even months. However, at some point the 
translation of the foreign version has to “catch up” with the English version.
You need to make sure during testing and reviews that:
•	 What is in the English version can be properly translated
•	 What is translated truly corresponds to the English version
•	 The translated product works flawlessly
Here’s the catch. These three things may be tested after the English version 
is finished and signed off on. During the testing and reviewing of a localized 
version, you will always find at least one challenging issue that can’t be solved 
except through a change to the English product.

However, be aware that a relatively simple and low-risk last-minute change 
in the English product, such as rephrasing a sentence (which takes only a few 
seconds to code), often requires several days to implement and retest for all 
the localized versions.
This can cost thousands of extra dollars, especially if you are contracting the 
translation work to an external company. The mistake that less experienced software development project managers often make is simple. They underestimate 
the effect and magnitude of making unexpected changes to the English version.
Here are two main things you can do to prevent this:
•	 Add a “localization buffer” to the end of your schedule. End of schedule
means the effective deadline for any work on the English product included 
in your project schedule. Any changes that need to be done after that targeted end date must meet very specific and very strict criteria to “get in” to 
the rework queue. Every change to this version also necessitates changes 
to the foreign ones.
•	 Sequence the tasks in a way that quality control of functionality is done 
separately from quality review of the English text. That can be as simple 
as copying all of the English text to a spreadsheet for proofing. That way, 
unclear wording can be found before the test cycle reveals it on an otherwise functioning product. Now, the necessary change can be done earlier 
and may not necessitate reworking other language versions.
