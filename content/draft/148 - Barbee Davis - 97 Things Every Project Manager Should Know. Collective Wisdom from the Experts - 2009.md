122 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Serve Your Team
Karen Gillison
Leesburg, Virginia, U.S.
Long before I heard of an agile* methodology, I worked with the 
best project manager I ever met. Looking back, he was using prototype techniques from the agile approach. He viewed his job as a facilitator for the team. 
He saw his day-to-day duties as identifying and removing obstacles, and providing team resources. He was doing things that increase team velocity.†
There were no multihour meetings where you fight to stay awake until it’s your 
turn to provide a status update—the ones where you wish you could escape 
and actually write some code, so you will have some progress to report for the 
next meeting. Instead, we started each project with a kick-off meeting, inviting people with job functions from requirements to testing. The whole team 
met to get a shared vision and understanding of the project. Then, every few 
days, the project manager would come by for what we called “doorway” status 
meetings. Each teammate gave a brief update on what was complete, what was 
in progress, and what issues were critical.
This project manager tracked project status in a visual, obvious way. He had a 
master spreadsheet for all the assignments, listing who should complete them. 
He updated this document regularly, and posted a large printout outside his 
doorway. Having information posted where we could all see it was great for 
team communication. An added bonus was that it was also visible to upperlevel members of management, and provided them with a self-service way of 
getting status updates whenever they wanted.
* Agile: An evolving methodology that promotes a software project management process that 
encourages shorter planning phases, more adaptability to change, teamwork, unit testing, personal 
accountability, and frequent customer involvement. 
† Velocity: A term used in agile software development to show the rate of progress for a team or a 
team member, i.e., how much an individual programmer will be able to produce in a given time 
period.

A few words about “ego.” My favorite project manager had the maturity and 
self-discipline to keep his ego out of the way. Even though he was the boss, 
he didn’t abuse his power, change tasks, or shift direction based on a whim. 
His actions were never detrimental to team productivity, since his main goal 
was to facilitate the team’s progress toward excellence.
By controlling his ego, he and the team achieved amazing results with satisfied 
end-users and upper management, all while meeting budget and time constraints. Because this management style was so effective, there was a noticeable 
absence of all-nighters, yelling, and general tension at the end of the project. 
In less mature corporate environments, a project manager and a smoothly 
performing team may not be recognized, because every project will seem 
easy. Even without acknowledgment, satisfaction came to our team members 
through doing right by the company, the end-users, and one another.
Today, an agile approach can provide new tools to make you a more effective project manager. I suggest you familiarize yourself with them, even if you 
aren’t fortunate enough to work for an organization that has adopted these 
methodologies. Instead, begin integrating these tools into your traditional 
project management toolbox. Realize that one of the key roles of the project 
manager is to increase the team’s velocity, and to work towards creating a team 
environment with few inhibitors to productivity.
