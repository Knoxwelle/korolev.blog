170 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
The Value of 
Planning

“In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is 
indispensable.”
—Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States
Some project managers prefer the quote, “No plan survives contact with 
the enemy,” by General George S. Patton. They reason that it is a waste of time 
to create plans, since they will be invalid almost from the beginning. This attitude has doomed many projects to failure. There will always be managers who 
advocate action over planning. Action is seductive, planning is boring.
Boring as it may be, the sole purpose of planning is not to create a set of documents. Eisenhower realized that the discipline of planning causes you to think 
about your project. The planning sessions create a deeper understanding of 
the project. You address work, budget, resources, risks, timelines, and more. 
As you plan, you gain greater insight into what is needed for success. Your 
plans will also help you understand if, and how, goals can be achieved. Completed plans are an invaluable way to communicate about the project.
Planning documents record what was discussed and decided. They do not 
exist to inflexibly dictate a course of action. Unfortunately, the originals will 
quickly lose their value and relevance. That is why we have two types of planning: initial and ongoing.
The goal of initial planning is to set the course of the project. Initial planning 
looks at the project as a whole and considers all areas (risk, time, quality, etc.). 
The initial plan sets the intent of the project, and maps a reasonable course to 
the objectives. The course will change as more information is gained and the 
situation changes. This is natural. A change in the objectives is less common, 
and should only be done with caution.

To create an initial plan, you must think about your project, understand the 
risks and limitations, and build a path to success. As the project manager, you 
take your team through planning sessions to do this. Creating an initial level 
of mutual understanding is vital, particularly right after “first contact with the 
enemy…” reality.
First contact is when the act of planning pays off. Because everyone understands the plan, each member can react independently in accordance with the 
intent of the plan. Knowing the overall goals and restrictions allows your team 
to make the right decisions quickly. This is when ongoing planning kicks in.
Your ongoing planning process starts with the existing plan and modifies it 
to account for the new reality. You planned to start development on May 1st, 
but now you can’t start until June 1st. How do you make up the time? Can you 
assign your resources to other tasks that can be done in May? Do you need 
more time, more money? These are your ongoing planning considerations. 
You plan, adjust, and then execute.
Each time you plan, you are thinking and communicating about your project. 
These necessary and fundamental activities will never fail to yield benefits well 
beyond their cost.
