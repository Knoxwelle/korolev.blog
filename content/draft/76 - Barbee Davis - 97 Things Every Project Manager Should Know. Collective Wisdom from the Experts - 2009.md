50 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Use a Wiki
Adrian Wible
New York, New York, U.S.
Wikis are a great mechanism to centralize access to your project information. Hopefully, the wiki will be updated multiple times daily and will 
always be open in a window on team members’ desktops.
To prevent you from wasting any precious brain cells that may be needed for 
the actual project work, I’ve provided some suggestions for pages you might 
include on your wiki. While creating these, you are sure to have ideas about 
customizing the site for your own software project:
•	 Stakeholders. Have space for topics such as up-to-the-minute project status, short-term issues, long-term issues, risk, budget tracking, and milestone achievements.
•	 Developers. Add information such as the connection string to connect to 
the QA database. Fellow programmers won’t wasting time trying to locate 
the code from other random sources. Team members can share information on topics like coding standards, build and deployment procedures, 
common pitfalls, and use of advanced coding techniques such as dependency injection.
•	 General information. The software project manager should add the help 
desk phone number, team roles and responsibilities, and individual team 
member contact information here.
•	 Team calendars. Use this site to post team calendars. One great trick is to 
use an embedded iFrame pointing to a Google calendar.
•	 Meeting minutes. Archive meeting minutes so the team can easily refresh 
its memory on the details covered in past meetings. Also, team members 
can quickly reference the minutes to research or prepare for future meetings.

•	 Meeting agenda. Set up a process for stakeholders to suggest future 
agenda items online. Subject, of course, to the approval of the software 
project manager, the necessity for the item to be presented to the entire 
team, and the time limitations of the next meeting.
•	 Business analyst. Often this person is not colocated in the developer workspace. This is a perfect space to centralize access to working documents and 
domain artifacts that can be accessed from multiple locations.
•	 Testers. The organizational structure may separate testing responsibility 
from the programmer. This site can provide a clearinghouse between the 
two teams. Post topics like how to use testing tools such as Selenium, QTP, 
and Quality Center. Bug-tracking procedures can be developed and discussed online, and the final decisions posted here.
Some tips:
•	 Don’t duplicate information. If the information lies elsewhere, link to that 
information instead of copying it into the wiki.
•	 Keep an eye on the volume of changes to make sure the information is not 
getting stale. If it does, people will stop using the wiki.
•	 Try to make your information real-time-data–driven if possible. Look for 
project management tools that include a wiki interface to enable creation 
of charts and status that is driven from the actual project data. This gives 
real-time status for the work in progress.
Any time you send project information via email, particularly with file attachments (documents, project plans, budget information, etc.), you should consider whether the team wiki would be a more appropriate place to exchange 
and archive that information.
