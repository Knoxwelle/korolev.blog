104 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Align Vision and 
Expected Outcome
David Diaz Castillo, MBA, PMP

Software development projects are very challenging, because needs 
and expectations are not always well defined. The work of a software project 
manager is to make sure that the following items are in place:
•	 The main project purpose is well defined.
•	 Everybody understands why this project is being undertaken.
•	 The impact for the three Ps (people, processes, and platforms) is clear.
•	 The needs and expectations are included in the requirements documents. 
Determine what items are in scope or out of scope, then communicate this 
to the team.
The software project manager needs to align team members with the vision 
and the expected outcomes, and master these three additional points:
1. Business view. Why is this project the solution? (What problem or 
opportunity is this project going to solve, or how will this add value to 
the organization?)
2. SMART view. What should the software do? (Make it Specific, Measurable, 
Agreed upon, Realistic, and possible to do within the Time constraint.)
3. Subjective view. What does the end-user think the system will do? 
(Capture expectations and perceptions from the end-users during the 
initiating phase.)
Point #1. When coding begins, the programming team and the software 
project manager focus on the functionality and the technical part of the 
project, not the main reason that the organization is funding this endeavor.

Future misunderstandings, pitfalls, and errors in the decisions we make happen because the team is not constantly reminded of the real business problem 
to be solved. The benefits that this project should bring to the organization 
are not always at the forefront. To avoid this pitfall, the project manager needs 
to crystallize the purpose, assumptions, constraints, and risks for the project.
Point #2. The technical and functional objective of the project must be clear 
enough for all team members to grasp, including the project sponsor. The outcomes have to be aligned with the strategic objectives of the business area that 
eventually will become the owner of the system.
Point #3. The software project manager should identify what end-users expect. 
How do they think this new application is going to help them in their day-to-day 
work? The project manager must be clear on these benefits and expectations and 
communicate them to the development team to get its buy-in. With that clarity, 
he/she can move forward to convey the advantages accurately to the end-users 
and help them form a realistic vision of the end software product.
With this detailed grasp of project purpose and benefit, on-the-fly decisions 
become easier. And, as the software project manager really knows what the 
users expect and what the system is intended to do, he/she is able to evaluate 
change control submissions more effectively. This prevents misdirection or 
tangents occurring during the project execution phase.
We as project managers should discipline ourselves to truly understand 
both the technical project requirements and the business value the project is 
intended to provide. With this knowledge, we will be prepared to create better 
software results and manage uncertainty in a professional way throughout the 
project life cycle.
