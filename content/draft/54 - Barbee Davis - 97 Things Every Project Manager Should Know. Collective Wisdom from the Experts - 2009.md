28 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Size Matters
Anupam Kundu
New York, New York, U.S.
The size of the project, the size of the team, the size of the deliverables, 
and the size of the checklists—everything in a project depends on its SIZE. 
Size changes the rules of how the game is played.
The bigger the project gets (in size or complexity), the more important it 
becomes for a project manager to break down the project into manageable 
modules and share the delivery responsibility of these modules with capable 
people. This will ensure that key project members, including the project manager, can see the “big picture” without getting lost in the details while scouting 
for project health statistics.
Distributed projects tend to be bigger in size than other projects types; hence, 
the tactics the project manager uses to manage the size actually impacts the 
bottom line of the project. The word “big” conjures up a variety of images. 
It can mean anything from eight people working for 12 months (if you are a 
small vendor) to hundreds of people working on annual maintenance contracts (if you are an enormous IT partner for your client).
Here are a few suggestions on how to carve out the right size for the project and then make sure that everyone understands how the small parts of the 
puzzle can make or break the big picture:
•	 Break down the project into as many independent, yet manageable, workstreams as possible.
•	 Make sure each workstream has at least one key contact point responsible 
for its delivery.
•	 If possible, try to have key members play overlapping roles in these workstreams so that the “big picture” is shared across the teams.

•	 Track the progress (use any tool) of each workstream separately, and tie 
up the metrics at regular intervals to feel the pulse of the overall project.
•	 Document and share the risks, issues, assumptions, and dependencies of 
each workstream separately.
•	 Organize regular team meetings to share the status of each and every 
workstream.
•	 Publish an overall project roadmap, including release plans from all different workstreams.
•	 Use online tools aggressively to share user requirements, milestone 
updates, bug reports, report timelines, and risks.
For example, imagine you are entrusted with building three versions of the 
same website (North America, Asia-Pacific, and Mid-East). You decide it is 
best to create three different workstreams, each with an independent delivery 
contact person. Since all three sites are basically the same sites in a different 
version (leading to medium customization), have a few key resources float 
across all three workstreams. This way, they can ensure the overall integrity of 
the sites and suggest reuse of implementation details.
Another example might be that you have multiple integration vendors for a single project. It might be ideal to separate out each integration point (or a related 
collection of them) into an individual workstream. This will allow simultaneous 
channels of work and may shorten the delivery time. Involve the different teams 
in daily meetings to coordinate the overall quality of the delivery.
