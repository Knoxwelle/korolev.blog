188 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Share the Vision

Do you work with idiots? Do your team members want to bankrupt the 
company? Sometimes it feels that way, but it’s usually not the case. The truth 
is, everyone wants to succeed and feel proud of their contributions, no matter how much it appears that they’re trying to sabotage your project. They are 
doing what they think is the right thing, but everyone has a different idea of 
what “right” is.
As the software project manager, how do you get everyone working together? 
Know that most teams labor in darkness. They don’t know why this project 
matters, how it fits into the company’s larger strategy, or why the deadline is 
June 17th. Since they don’t understand why certain decisions were made, the 
choices appear arbitrary and irrational. Everyone struggles, trying to form a 
clear vision of this murky situation without any definitive information to help 
them. Should we be surprised that everyone see a different end goal to the 
project?
To clear away the fog, you need to share with your team members the key pieces 
of data that will make them knowledgeable about your common endeavor. Let 
them know that the project needs to ship in mid-June to beat a competitor’s 
product to market by three weeks. Help them understand that this project fills 
a need in a larger corporate strategy to expand internationally, or that your 
customer is counting on it to shore up dwindling profits from its existing, but 
aging, product line.

Be careful, if you’re new at sharing information. As the conduit of information 
for your team, you’ll also be shaping the team’s morale. When you decide to 
gripe about another group or manager, or a member of your team, your negative attitude can spread through your team as quickly as the flu. And, like a 
viral infection, it can slow your team’s verve for days.
A great way to share project information is to hold a daily meeting. Teams with 
10 people or so can meet effectively in as little as 10–20 minutes. Each person 
has a one- to two-minute opportunity to bring the team up-to-date on his own 
progress and ask for help, if he needs it. These quick “standups” are the perfect 
place for the software project manager to share project updates.
When you opt for a weekly (or monthly) meeting, you may forget important information; after all, it’s old news to you by the time the group finally 
assembles. Or a problem that could have been prevented blows up because you 
delayed sharing risk indicators. Perhaps the team will glaze over after you’ve 
shared 17 bits of “vital” information all stuffed into one, bloated team talk.
Remember, your team, and everyone at your company, wants to succeed. Share 
your vision and ask others to share theirs. You’ll find most of those idiots you 
thought were out to close the company are actually people who will work sideby-side with you to solve mutually understood team challenges.
