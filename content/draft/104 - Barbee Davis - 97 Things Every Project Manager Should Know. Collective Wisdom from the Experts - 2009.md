78 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Chart a Course 
for Change

New software changes the way in which people work. This may 
be good for the organization, but the people who work there aren’t always 
ready to embrace change. And let’s face it, if people can’t be convinced, cajoled, 
or commanded to use your new software, it’s been a big waste of time and 
money.
When requiring people to change the ways in which they work, the carrot 
method (reward) is much better than the stick (punishment). Even if they’re 
forced to adopt it, if your new software does not provide significant benefits 
that users can understand and master, they will find every way possible to 
avoid using it. Proper care must be taken to 1) understand the impact of this 
change on the people it touches, and 2) put in place change-management plans 
that help these people embrace the change.
Key to understanding the impact of the change is to understand how people 
currently work and exactly how the new software will change that process. This 
increases the chances that users will adopt the new system, and also improves 
the design of your end-product, as it ensures that it will fit user needs.
The importance of change management cannot be underestimated and should 
be a project manager’s focus early on in the project. To determine the impact 
of the change on users, first document all current (“as is”) processes that touch 
the software project. Create process flow diagrams that detail daily tasks as 
well as data inputs and outputs.

Next, document how these processes will differ once the new software has 
been rolled out. Speak frankly with target users of the new software. Discuss 
how the changes will affect their work. Listen carefully, evaluate the impact and 
costs of each feature change, and adjust the software design accordingly. Make 
sure that the changes will be acceptable to target users and their management.
Involve managers of the target user community early and often. They will 
be important champions of change who can make or break the transition to 
the new system by incentivizing and/or mandating that end-users make the 
switch. They are invaluable partners to remove obstacles and solve unforeseen 
issues with the rollout.
Create a plan for change. Determine the list of training and team-building 
activities that will need to happen prior to the project launch, and build these 
into your project schedule. Enlist help from the management community to 
create the change management plan. At a minimum, this group must buy into 
the concepts, implementation and training approach, and timelines wholeheartedly. Listen carefully for objections or warnings about approaches that 
will not work with their teams.
In summary, users and their management are interested in keeping their focus 
squarely on meeting their business objectives. Transitions to new processes, 
tools, and systems pose a potential threat to these goals. Solid upfront planning helps provide a smooth transition to the new system, paves the way for 
buy-in and acceptance, and increases the chances of its long-term use.
