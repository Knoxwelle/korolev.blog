142 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
It’s the People, 
Stupid

Never lose sight of the fact that the members of your project team are 
human beings, with aspirations, strengths, constraints, and weaknesses. Your 
project’s success hinges more on team members’ attitudes and aptitudes than 
it does on your Gantt chart wizardry and project tracking prowess. Feel free to 
manage the project, but don’t forget to lead the team.
Many of us manage projects in a matrix environment with team members 
reporting both to us and to a department manager. We do not have human 
resources (HR) hiring/firing/evaluation responsibility for them. However, 
don’t abdicate responsibility for the care and feeding of the people on the team 
to managers in the HR or functional hierarchy.
Many of those managers get promoted based on technical knowledge of 
human resources or their departments, not on their ability to inspire people. 
Your project’s success depends on your ability to lead. There are many books 
available on leadership. Read voraciously.
Everyone on your team wants to contribute, learn, and achieve. It may be challenging at times to dig deeply enough to find this desire in some team members, but it’s what makes software project management challenging and fun.
Hold one-on-one conversations with your team members regularly. Determine what their issues are, ask them for ideas, and give them a voice in the 
project. Take their input seriously and act on it.
Ask your team members what they want to be when they grow up. Seriously. 
We all have career aspirations. Be the one mentor who cares about their 
careers. You’ll be amazed at how powerful this can be.

Be open, honest, and direct with team members. Provide feedback on a regular 
basis, not just at review time. Focus your feedback on the behavior, not the 
person. Again, management literature abounds. Study.
When you have a performance issue with a team member, apply the CRAM 
model: Constraints, Resources, Aptitude, and Motivation. Project managers 
frequently diagnose poor performance as a motivation problem. The CRAM 
model suggests that motivation is the last issue to consider. A team member 
may be experiencing constraints in his life that limit his effectiveness. Examples 
include getting divorced or married, having kids, fighting addiction issues, etc.
Team members may not have the resources necessary to contribute at their 
highest level. Examples include no quality assurance (QA) test environment, 
or ancient hardware. Perhaps budget constraints limit the ability to establish testing environments or buy licenses for necessary software. Perhaps the 
domain expertise (business analyst, customer, end-user) is not accessible.
Your team member may not be cut out for the role he/she fills. He may not have the 
programming aptitude necessary for this project. If so, find another project role, 
if possible. Alternatively, find another team where he can leverage his strengths.
Motivation is the last lever to jiggle when a team member has performance 
issues. It should only be considered once the constraints, resources, and aptitude problems have been addressed.
Be a leader and connect with the individual human beings who comprise your 
team. The results may surprise you.
