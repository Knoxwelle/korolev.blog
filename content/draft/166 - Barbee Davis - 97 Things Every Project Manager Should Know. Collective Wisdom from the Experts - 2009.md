140 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
A Project Is the 
Pursuit of a 
Solution
Cynthia A. Berg, PhD (ABD), PMP

Author Stephen Covey states , “begin with the end in mind.” And 
what is a project, except the pursuit of an end solution? The best way to conceptualize the end of a software project is to create a work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS is a hierarchical view, which shows the entire scope of 
the project broken down into deliverables,*
 much like an organizational chart 
shows company divisions broken into departments and then work teams. The 
deliverables are then divided into smaller and smaller components until they 
get to the work package†
 level.
Include the team, sponsors, and other stakeholders when creating a WBS. This 
ensures that the work of the project is fully defined and represents the needs 
of all of the participants. Why include the team? Well, who knows the work 
that needs to be done better than the project team members who will actually 
do those tasks? Projects are doomed to fail when the project manager assumes 
that he/she alone knows how to list every facet of the work of the project.
While creating a WBS, the team has an opportunity to challenge the norms 
of “how we’ve always done it.” Plus, team members are formulating a shared 
opinion on what constitutes the work of the project. This method ensures that 
they will have more buy-in for the effort. After all, it’s always more interesting 
to work on a project you helped to design.
How small should the activities of the WBS be broken down? That’s a trick 
question. There are no activities shown in the WBS, since it is only divided to 
the work package level. Once that work package is assigned to the department, 
group, vendor, or subcontractor who will complete it, it can be broken down 
* Deliverable: A product, result, or capability to perform a service that is created through the work of a 
project.
† Work package: The smallest portion of a deliverable, including activities and schedule milestones. 
The goal is to be able to assign it to one person, group, or vendor.

further into the activities and milestones necessary to ensure that it is done 
efficiently and with quality processes. Each assignee for a work package, the 
lowest level of work, should create his or her own smaller project plan portion 
that will flow back into the master schedule.
The WBS then becomes the backbone for all other planning, executing, monitoring, and controlling functions within the project. It also serves as a succinct communication tool for those both internal and external to the project. 
A graphic representation of a WBS is a picture of the project solution. Once 
that picture is completed, the detailed planning, scheduling, and budgeting 
can begin. How can you plan, budget, and schedule before you have clearly 
defined the work of the project?
The WBS is also invaluable as a brainstorming tool. With a graphic representation that displays the entirety of the project, it’s easy to spot omissions, redundancies, or fertile pockets of work that could easily be enhanced to leverage 
the value of the project. To identify potential risks (both internal and external), 
look at each portion of the WBS.
A little time up front to get a clear work breakdown structure that is prepared, 
understood, and agreed upon among all stakeholders is a recipe for project 
excellence.
