8 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know
Make Project 
Sponsors Write Their 
Own Requirements

Project failure is not just a problem with American corporations. 
According to a survey conducted several years ago by one of Japan’s leading 
information technology magazines, more than 75% of the projects that are 
undertaken by Japanese corporations are considered a failure when measured 
against the metrics of quality, cost, and delivery.
In Japan, as in most other nations, the top reason for failure in each metric is 
almost always the same: poor requirements definition. The companies that are 
most at risk are those with poor business analysis capabilities. When specifically 
reporting on technology projects, such as software development, success is categorized, euphemistically, as “improbable.” This result shows how difficult it is to 
find, identify, and define true requirements for a software project.
Since it is so hard to do, many project owners—such as customers, project 
sponsors, or company executives—expect the project manager to define and 
refine the requirements for the software on her own. They do not provide 
much in the way of guidance or a clear definition of what they need. Since it is 
a software project, and they may not understand software development themselves, they assume that they don’t have to define what they expect.
The software project manager usually does not have the authority or the time 
to find, select, and prioritize the project requirements on her own—especially 
since there may be several interest groups involved in the project that probably have conflicting ideas about what they envision the software will do upon 
completion.

It’s up to the project manager to spend time with those who are funding the 
software project to help them define exactly what they want before the project 
starts. Is it more important that it is done quickly, with few bugs, or on as small a 
budget as possible? You can’t have it all. What resources and skill sets are crucial 
to create the software they want? Are they making these resources available to 
the team?
How will the software be used to run the infrastructure or make money for the 
company? Are the time constraints realistic? Are they written into a customer 
contract, tied to an important holiday date, or part of an elaborate marketing 
plan?
Without serious, specific consideration of what is to be created on this project 
during the requirement definition phase, the success of the project is severely 
jeopardized. Remember, project owners need to convey what they want this 
software to do, not how the programmers will go about producing that result.
Convince the project owners that they must be involved in the process from 
start to finish. Solid requirements planning establishes a clear connection 
between the business case, project goals, and the project outcome. Otherwise, 
the project cannot produce the satisfactory result they are expecting.
A failed software project hurts the project owners most, since they have put up 
the money to fund the project and were expecting to use the software to earn 
back their investment.
