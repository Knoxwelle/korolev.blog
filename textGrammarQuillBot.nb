in your group will read a 100-page document justifying your architectural \

to the success of any program project.From the very beginning of work on the \
project adhere to simple explanations and in no case start making long \
descriptions in Word.Use tools like Visio to create simple charts that \
explain your ideas.Diagrams should be simple, because they will almost change \
frequently.Informal meetings are another effective means of disseminating \
information.The best way to communicate your thoughts to the project \
participants is to bring together a group of developers (or other architects) \
in one room and display your ideas on the board.Be sure to take a digital \
camera with you (nothing is more annoying than the requirement to release the \
conference room when you have just finished drawing). After the meeting, take \
a picture, multiply it and distribute to the rest of the participants via \
wiki.Postpone the creation of spacious documents and focus on bringing your \
ideas to colleagues, and then you can think of a more detailed presentation \
of your architectural solutions.\\n\\nMost software architects do not realize \
that they must also be leaders. To work in a healthy and productive \
environment, you as a leader must win the respect of your colleagues. Keeping \
developers unaware of what the overall picture looks like and why certain \
decisions are made is the right path to disaster. On the contrary, by \
attracting the developers to your side, you create a collective working \
environment in which the correctness of your architectural decisions is \
checked. In turn, connecting designers to the architecture creation process \
ensures their commitment and interest.\\n\\nKeep in mind that clarity and \
leadership are important for interacting with all team members (not only with \
developers, but also with the testing team, business analysts and project \
managers). Clear communication and effective leadership enhance the quality \
of communication and create a strong and healthy working environment.\\n\\nIf \

nCustomers and end-users often demand what they think is an effective \

the leading designer of the F-16 Falcon. His group had set the goal of \
designing an aircraft developing M2\[Dash]2.5 speeds, which was (and probably \
remains) a very non-trivial task, especially if the accompanying objective \
was to create a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]cheap\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] light \
aircraft. Consider that the force required to overcome the air resistance \
increases by four times the speed of flight, and imagine how this \
circumstance affects the weight of the aircraft.\\n\\nWhen the design team \
asked the Air Force customers why they needed the M2\[Dash]2.5 speed, they \
replied, \\\"That the aircraft could get out of battle if necessary.\\\" When \
the real need became apparent, the designers were able to solve the main \
problem and present a workable solution: a mobile aircraft with high \
traction, providing good acceleration and maneuverability instead of high \
maximum speed.\\n\\nThe lesson is equally true in software development. \
Having learned from the customer the true meaning of the requested \
possibility or requirement, the architect will be able to penetrate the \
essence of the problem and, if lucky, offer a solution that is more quality \
and cost-effective compared to the one on which the client insists. Increased \
attention to the essence of requirements also simplifies the priority \
setting: the most important requirements for the customer become decisive.\\n\
\\nHow should we act? In the manifesto of agile development, there is a \

nThe fate of fate I started to go to interviews again, and I want to share \
some observations. On this, I just give advice to everyone in enterprise \
companies about how the recruitment process should be structured.\\n\\n## \
Advice to candidates\\n\\nIn the last five years, I've been through several \
hundred interviews on both sides. So, some life hacking:\\n\\nYou're going to \
have to go through the windshields. Those you're not going to go to. You pump \
the skill, or suddenly something interesting turns out to be, or it'll be the \
only place with the offer. You never know what's in a box of candy.\\n\\n - \
Get some sleep and let yourself rest on the day of wrath. The same live \
coding is quite a dumb thing; the solution may not come during the call but \
will appear immediately after.\\n- Take a glass of water. Drink in any \
unclear situation; it is a good and adequate filler.\\n- Talk to me. It's \
good if you can talk to your cat or colleague about distracted topics before \
the call. It helps relieve some tension.\\n- Take it easy. If they don't take \
you, nobody dies. Yeah, maybe it'll be harder, but in a year or two, you'll \
even say \\\"thank you.\\\" This attitude will help reduce the degree of \
stiffness a little.\\n- Be sure to ask for feedback. Without feedback, it's \
very hard to learn.\\n   I would like to remind you that refusal should be \
treated more easily. You just didn't fit this company for that position. It \
doesn't make you a bad person or a programmer. I received refusals with such \
words as \\\"overqualified\\\" and \\\"we thought you would fall somewhere \
and agree to the penny against quater,\\\" just flowers. Well, they don't \
have a job for me, maybe.\\n\\n## Advice to interviewers\\n\\nMore empathy. \
You are not a candidate, but a potential colleague. And you have no purpose \
in overthrowing him; your task is to understand if he can perform the duties \
that he will have and if it is comfortable for you to communicate. It's \
impossible to do that in an hour and a half.\\n\\n## Instead of conviction\\n\
\\nIn my 10 years in IT, I have worked for many types of companies. They were \
mainly start-ups or small companies with 20\[Dash]30 people. So, the \
interviews at the enterprise are strikingly different from theirs. Recruiters \
have a huge flow of vacancies and resumes, so wild options are possible at \
first sight. For example, after seven successful interviews, I was told that \
they could not find a position for me. WTF?! But as an excuse, I can say that \
they have streaming hiring. I mean, they're screwing everybody, \\\"and we're \
going to figure it out someday.\\\" And the processes are fully standardized. \
Whether you're a senior in Python with 15 years of referral experience or \
not, you still go through all the hell stages.\"\>"}],

nI've been going to interviews again, and I'd like to share some \
observations. This time we talk about live coding in enterprise companies and \
how the recruitment process should be constructed.\\n\\n## Live \
Coding\\n\\nThere's always a lot of noise around him. Some people like it \
(interviews), some people don't like it at all (candidates), and someone goes \
to a psychologist after him for six months. This is not really to understand \
that the candidate is able to code; there are not enough extensive projects \
on Github, profile articles with code, reports after all. As I was told, this \
is done to ensure that everyone is treated equally in recruitment. Well, good \
luck hiring a leader or a gentleman in five rounds. At the second, he'll ask \
himself, \\\"Do I really need this? Well, there are already three offers,\\\" \
and it will fall off.\\n\\nAll right, live coding. Usually, you get two tasks \
to program. Yeah, turn the trees. Do you know what roffle is? You come to \
them later, and they don't have any trees at all. There's an hour for \
everything. And how this hour will pass depends very much on the \
interlocutor. There are those who help reason, elaborate the IDE, set up a \
two-point, and, if forgotten, show some kind of empathy and \
support\[LongDash]the candidate is still stressed. Take care of them! Much \
more often, I get those who don't even turn on the cameras. They just give it \
a job and watch the attempts. At one of these sessions, I solved a three-hour \
task. Did I get an offer? (No.) \\\"Because you probably have a choice, so \
we're not going to communicate.\\\" Epic ~~fail~~win!\\n\\nThe most \
interesting live coding experience I've ever had was with one Canadian. We \
discussed and solved the problem together. Literally together, he wrote one \
part and I wrote the second, more complicated. And that's when I realized \
another problem of this session: one-sidedness. We have a co-interview at the \
end of the day. That is, the candidate should look after future colleagues. \
Can they code too? Working at VOTVASYA does not always involve this.\\n\\nAnd \
in a well-known company, they are asked to solve the problems for O(1), but \
it does not care about the amount of additional memory. It's easy to \
understand why their app weighs so much, but it still breaks. But the nuance \
is that in practice, such code is much more difficult to write and maintain \
because of the problems of synchronization of these very data structures. And \
it turns out that the interview turns into an Olympiad, and there is how \
lucky you are\[LongDash]if you slept, come up with a solution; no, nothing; \
you come up before sleeping.\\n\\nAnother reason why people do not like \
online programming is that the interviewer is not prepared. Encoding in a \
notebook with a scratched screen still occurs. Most often, of course, just \
some kind of online editor, and good if with syntax lighting. But to find \
such another half-business, you have to come up with a challenge. The \
strangest thing I had was \\\"Transfer money from account A to account B\\\"\
\[LongDash]and the white screen. No interfaces, no templates, not even a hint \
on the BD... And you just spend 10 minutes telling them what they want to \
see. What about writing classes? What fields? In short, all this support \
code, which is not directly related to the task,.\\n\\nAnd now what do we \
need to do? What I liked most was the discussion of some kind of PR. Here, \
without sarcasm, it is immediately clear how a person will behave in a \
working situation. What he is paying attention to, what he is missing, and \
why. For example, gentlemen usually ignore formatting because it's the work \
of linters and focus more on APIs, races, and optimum work with the base. I \
highly recommend trying.\"\>"}],
