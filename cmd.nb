complete\\nBefore:\\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that \
the end-to-end communications is set up using handshaking. Once the \
connection is set up, user data may be sent bi-directionally over the \
connection. Compared to TCP, UDP is a simpler message based connectionless \
protocol, which means that the end-to-end connection is not dedicated and \
information is transmitted in one direction from the source to its \
destination without verifying the readiness or state of the receiver. TCP \
controls message acknowledgment, retransmission and timeout. TCP makes \
multiple attempts to deliver messages that get lost along the way, In TCP \
therefore, there is no missing data, and if ever there are multiple timeouts, \
the connection is dropped.\\nParaphrased:\\nSince TCP is a \
connection-oriented protocol, handshaking is used to establish end-to-end \
conversations. User data can be sent over the connection in both directions \
once it has been established. In contrast to TCP, UDP is a more \
straightforward message-based connectionless protocol. This implies that data \
is sent from the source to the destination in a single direction without \
confirming the receiver's readiness or state. Message acknowledgment, \
retransmission, and timeout are all managed by TCP. There is never any \
missing data with TCP because it repeatedly tries to send messages that are \
lost en route. If a timeout occurs more than once, the connection is \
terminated.\\n\\r\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\korol\\\\YandexDisk\\\\Hugo\\\\project\\\\\

  RowBox[{"\<\"Rice is a cereal grain and in its domesticated form is the \
staple food of over half of the world's population, particularly in Asia and \
Africa. Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice)\
\[LongDash]or, much less commonly, Oryza glaberrima (African rice). Asian \
rice was domesticated in China some 13,500 to 8,200 years ago; African rice \
was domesticated in Africa about 3,000 years ago. Rice has become commonplace \
in many cultures worldwide; in 2021, 787 million tons were produced, placing \
it fourth after sugarcane, maize, and wheat. Only some 8% of rice is traded \
internationally. China, India, and Indonesia are the largest consumers of \
rice. A substantial amount of the rice produced in developing nations is lost \
after harvest through factors such as poor transport and storage. Rice yields \
can be reduced by pests including insects, rodents, and birds, as well as by \
weeds, and by diseases such as rice blast. Traditional rice polycultures such \
as rice-duck farming, and modern integrated pest management seek to control \
damage from pests in a sustainable way. \\nMany varieties of rice have been \
bred to improve crop quality and productivity. Biotechnology has created \
Green Revolution rice able to produce high yields when supplied with nitrogen \
fertiliser and managed intensively. Other products are rice able to express \
human proteins for medicinal use; flood-tolerant or deepwater rice; and \
drought-tolerant and salt-tolerant varieties. Rice is used as a model \
organism in biology.\\nDry rice grain is milled to remove the outer layers; \
depending on how much is removed, products range from brown rice to rice with \
germ and white rice. Some is parboiled to make it easy to cook. Rice contains \
no gluten; it provides protein but not all the essential amino acids needed \
for good health. Rice of different types is eaten around the world. \
Long-grain rice tends to stay intact on cooking; medium-grain rice is \
stickier, and is used for sweet dishes, and in Italy for risotto; and sticky \
short-grain rice is used in Japanese sushi as it keeps its shape when cooked. \
White rice when cooked contains 29% carbohydrate and 2% protein, with some \
manganese. Golden rice is a variety produced by genetic engineering to \
contain vitamin A.\\nProduction of rice is estimated to have caused over 1% \
of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. Predictions of how rice yields \
will be affected by climate change vary across geographies and socioeconomic \
contexts. In human culture, rice plays a role in certain religions and \
traditions, such as in weddings.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"== Description ==\\nThe rice plant can grow to over 1 m (3 ft) \
tall; if in deep water, it can reach a length of  5 m (16 ft). A single plant \
may have several leafy stems or tillers. The upright stem is jointed with \
nodes along its length; a long slender leaf arises from each node. The \
self-fertile flowers are produced in a panicle, a branched inflorescence \
which arises from the last internode on the stem. There can be up to 350 \
spikelets in a panicle, each containing male and female flower parts (anthers \
and ovule). A fertilised ovule develops into the edible grain or \
caryopsis.\\nRice is a cereal belonging to the family Poaceae. As a tropical \
crop, it can be grown during the two distinct seasons (dry and wet) of the \
year provided that sufficient water is made available. It is normally an \
annual, but in the tropics it can survive as a perennial, producing a ratoon \
crop.\"\>", ",", "\<\"== Agronomy ==\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Growing ===\\nLike all crops, rice depends for its growth on \
both biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The principal biotic factors \
are crop variety, pests, and plant diseases. Abiotic factors include the soil \
type, whether lowland or upland, amount of rain or irrigation water, \
temperature, day length, and intensity of sunlight.\\nRice grains can be \
planted directly into the field where they will grow, or seedlings can be \
grown in a seedbed and transplanted into the field. Direct seeding needs some \
60 to 80 kg of grain per hectare, while transplanting needs less, around 40 \
kg per hectare, but requires far more labour.  Most rice in Asia is \
transplanted by hand. Mechanical transplanting takes less time but requires a \
carefully-prepared field and seedlings raised on mats or in trays to fit the \
machine. Rice does not thrive if continuously submerged. Rice can be grown in \
different environments, depending upon water availability. The usual \
arrangement is for lowland fields to be surrounded by bunds and flooded to a \
depth of a few centimetres until around a week before harvest time; this \
requires a large amount of water. The \\\"alternate wetting and drying\\\" \
technique uses less water. One form of this is to flood the field to a depth \
of 5 cm (2 in), then to let the water level drop to 15 cm (6 in) below \
surface level, as measured by looking into a perforated field water tube sunk \
into the soil, and then repeating the cycle. Deepwater rice varieties \
tolerate flooding to a depth of over 50 centimetres for at least a month. \
Upland rice is grown without flooding, in hilly or mountainous regions; it is \
rainfed like wheat or maize.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Harvesting ===\\nAcross Asia, unmilled rice or \\\"paddy\\\" \
(Indonesian and Malay padi), was traditionally the product of smallholder \
agriculture, with manual harvesting. Larger farms make use of machines such \
as combine harvesters to reduce the input of labour. The grain is ready to \
harvest when the moisture content is 20\[Dash]25%. Harvesting involves \
reaping, stacking the cut stalks, threshing to separate the grain, and \
cleaning by winnowing or screening. The rice grain is dried as soon as \
possible to bring the moisture content down to a level that is safe from \
mould fungi. Traditional drying relies on the heat of the sun, with the grain \
spread out on mats or on pavements.\"\>", ",", "\<\"== Evolution ==\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Phylogeny ===\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"The edible rice species are members of the BOP clade within the \
grass family, the Poaceae. The rice subfamily, Oryzoideae, is sister to the \
bamboos, Bambusoideae, and the cereal subfamily Pooideae. The rice genus \
Oryza is one of eleven in the Oryzeae; it is sister to the Phyllorachideae. \
The edible rice species O. sativa and O. glaberrima are among some 300 \
species or subspecies in the genus.\"\>", ",", "\<\"=== History ===\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"Oryza sativa rice was first domesticated in China 9,000 years \
ago, by people of Neolithic cultures in the Upper and Lower Yangtze, \
associated with Hmong-Mien-speakers and pre-Austronesians, respectively. The \
functional allele for nonshattering, the critical indicator of domestication \
in grains, as well as five other single-nucleotide polymorphisms, is \
identical in both indica and japonica. This implies a single domestication \
event for O. sativa. Both indica and japonica forms of Asian rice sprang from \
a single domestication event in China from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon. \
Despite this evidence, it appears that indica rice arose when japonica \
arrived in India about 4,500 years ago and hybridised with another rice, \
whether an undomesticated proto-indica or wild O. nivara. \\nRice was \
introduced early into Sino-Tibetan cultures in northern China by around 6000 \
to 5600 years ago, and to the Korean peninsula and Japan by around 5500 to \
3200 years ago. It was also carried into Taiwan by the Dapenkeng culture by \
5500 to 4000 years ago, before spreading southwards via the Austronesian \
migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and Guam, but did not \
survive the voyage to the rest of the Pacific. It reached Austroasiatic and \
Kra-Dai-speakers in Mainland Southeast Asia and southern China by 5000 years \
ago. \\nRice spread around the rest of the world through cultivation, \
migration and trade, eventually to the Americas as part of the Columbian \
exchange after 1492. The now less common Oryza glaberrima (African rice) was \
independently domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago, and introduced \
to the Americas by the Spanish.\"\>", ",", "\<\"== Commerce ==\"\>",

major producers were Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. 90% of world \
production is from Asia.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Yield records ===\\nThe average world yield for rice was 4.7 \
metric tons per hectare (2.1 short tons per acre), in 2022. Yuan Longping of \
China's National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center set a world \
record for rice yield in 1999 at 17.1 metric tons per hectare (7.6 short tons \

rice and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), an innovation in rice \
farming.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Food security ===\\nRice is a major food staple in Asia, \
Latin America, and some parts of Africa, feeding over half the world's \
population. However, a substantial part of the crop can be lost post-harvest \
through inefficient transportation, storage, and milling. A quarter of the \
crop in Nigeria is lost after harvest. Storage losses include damage by mould \
fungi if the rice is not dried sufficiently. In China, losses in modern metal \
silos were just 0.2%, compared to 7\[Dash]13% when rice was stored by rural \
households.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Processing ===\\nThe dry grain is milled to remove the outer \
layers, namely the husk and bran. These can be removed in a single step, in \
two steps, or as in commercial milling in a multi-step process of cleaning, \
dehusking, separation, polishing, grading, and weighing. Brown rice only has \
the inedible husk removed. Further milling removes bran and the germ to \
create successively whiter products. Parboiled rice is subjected to a \
steaming process before it is milled. This makes the grain harder, and moves \
some of the grain's vitamins and minerals into the white part of the rice so \
these are retained after milling. Rice does not contain gluten, so is \
suitable for people on a gluten-free diet. Rice is a good source of protein \
and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a complete \
protein as it does not contain all of the essential amino acids in sufficient \
amounts for good health.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Trade ===\\nWorld trade figures are much smaller than those \
for production, as less than 8% of rice produced is traded internationally. \
\\nChina, an exporter of rice in the early 2000s, had become the world's \
largest importer of rice by 2013. Developing countries are the main players \
in the world rice trade; by 2012, India was the largest exporter of rice, \
with Thailand and Vietnam the other largest exporters.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Worldwide consumption ===\\nAs of 2016, the countries that \
consumed the most rice were China (29% of total), India, and Indonesia. By \
2020, Bangladesh had taken third place from Indonesia. On an annual average \
from 2020-23, China consumed 154 million tonnes of rice, India consumed 109 \
million tonnes, and Bangladesh and Indonesia consumed about 36 million tonnes \
each. Across the world, rice consumption per capita fell in the 21st century \
as people in Asia and elsewhere ate less grain and more meat. An exception is \
Sub-Saharan Africa, where both per capita consumption of rice and population \
are increasing.\"\>", ",", "\<\"== Food ==\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Eating qualities ===\\nRice is a commonly-eaten food around \
the world. The varieties of rice are typically classified as short-, medium-, \
and long-grained. Oryza sativa indica varieties are usually long-grained; \
Oryza sativa japonica varieties are usually short- or medium-grained. \
Short-grain rice, with the exception of Spanish Bomba, is usually sticky when \
cooked, and is suitable for puddings. Thai Jasmine rice is aromatic, and \
unusually for a long-grain rice has some stickiness, with a soft texture. \
Indian Basmati rice is very long-grained and aromatic. Italian Arborio rice, \
used for risotto, is of medium length, oval, and quite sticky. Japanese sushi \
rice is a sticky short-grain variety.\"\>",

calories of food energy, and contains moderate levels of manganese (18% DV), \
with no other micronutrients in significant content (all less than 10% of the \

estimated at 5.7 billion tonnes CO2eq, representing 1.2% of total emissions. \
Within the agriculture sector, rice produces almost half the greenhouse gas \
emissions from croplands, some 30% of agricultural methane emissions, and 11% \
of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions. Methane is released from rice fields \
subject to long-term flooding, as this inhibits the soil from absorbing \
atmospheric oxygen, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic matter in \
the soil. Emissions can be limited by planting new varieties, not flooding \
continuously, and removing straw.\\nIt is possible to cut methane emissions \
in rice cultivation by improved water management, combining dry seeding and \
one drawdown, or executing a sequence of wetting and drying. This results in \
emission reductions of up to 90% compared to full flooding and even increased \
yields.\"\>", 
   ",", "\<\"=== Effects of climate change on rice production \
===\\nPredictions of climate change's effects on rice cultivation vary. \
Global rice yield has been projected to decrease by around 3.2% with each 1\
\[Degree]C increase in global average temperature while another study \
predicts global rice cultivation will increase initially, plateauing at about \
3\[Degree]C warming (2091\[Dash]2100 relative to 1850\[Dash]1900).\\nThe \
impacts of climate change on rice cultivation will vary across geographic \
location and socioeconomic contexts. For example, rising temperatures and \
decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century \
decreased rice yield by between 10% and 20% across 200 farms in seven Asian \
countries. This may have been caused by increased night-time respiration. \
IRRI has predicted that Asian rice yields will fall by some 20% per \
1\[Degree]C rise in global mean temperature. Further, rice is unable to yield \
grain if the flowers experience a temperature of 35 \[Degree]C or more for \
over one hour, so the crop would be lost under these conditions. \\nIn the Po \
Valley in Italy, the arborio and carnaroli risotto rice varieties have \
suffered poor harvests through drought in the 21st century. The Ente \
Nazionale Risi  is developing drought-resistant varieties; its nuovo prometeo \

resurgence of populations of rice pests such as the brown planthopper, both \
by destroying beneficial insects and by enhancing the pest's reproduction. \
The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an \
87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers. \

traditionally managed weeds and pests by the polycultural practice of raising \
ducks and sometimes fish in their rice paddies. These produce valuable \
additional crops, eat small pest animals, manure the rice, and in the case of \

to protect themselves from pest attacks. Some synthetic chemicals, such as \
the herbicide 2,4-D, cause the plant to increase the production of certain \
defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plant's resistance to some types \
of pests. Conversely, other chemicals, such as the insecticide imidacloprid, \
appear to induce changes in the gene expression of the rice that make the \
plant more susceptible to certain pests.\\nPlant breeders have created rice \

inserted the DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene, from the Philippine upland rice \
variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, \
giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants. This \
facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required \
nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature \

can severely affect rice plants' physiology, especially during early stages \
of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these \
areas.\\nProgress has been made in developing rice varieties capable of \
tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the \
commercial rice variety IR56 and the wild rice species Oryza coarctata is one \
example. O. coarctata can grow in soils with double the limit of salinity of \
normal varieties, but does not produce edible rice. Developed by the \

specialised leaf glands that remove salt into the atmosphere. It was produced \

12C. Sowing takes place once the daily average temperature is reliably above \
this limit. Average temperatures below that reduce growth; if sustained for \
over four days, germination and seedling growth are harmed and seedlings may \
die. In larger plants subjected to cold, rice blast is encouraged, seriously \
reducing yield. As of 2022, researchers continue to study the mechanisms of \
chilling tolerance in rice and its genetic basis. \"\>",

is harmful for the environment due to the release of methane by methanogenic \
bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, consuming \
nutrients released by rice roots. Putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice \
creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot, decreasing the \
methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of \

possessed some 110,000 landraces of rice with diverse and valuable \
properties. These include enrichment in vital nutrients and the ability to \
withstand flood, drought, salinity or pest infestations. The Green Revolution \
covered fields with a few high-yielding varieties, so that roughly 90 percent \
of the landraces vanished from farmers' collections. High-yielding varieties \
require expensive inputs. They perform abysmally on marginal farms or in \
adverse environmental conditions, forcing poor farmers into debt.\\nSingh, B. \
