communication.  \\nAt the same time, simply possessing the techniques of \
communication as a technology is not enough. Respect for people, the ability \
to give them credit of trust are essential skills that turn a smart leader \
into an effective.  \\nOf course, the matter is not exhausted, but a few \
simple tips will significantly increase the effectiveness of your \
communication with subordinates:  \\n\[Bullet] Consider the discussion of \
problems as a constructive dialogue rather than a conflict situation.\\nStart \
from positive assumptions about people and view communication as an \
opportunity to ask questions that interest you; so you will definitely be \
able to get more useful information, and your interlocutors will not take a \
defensive position.  \\n\[Bullet] Start the conversation only in a mood \
suitable for communication.  \\nIf you are angry, irritated, upset and out of \
balance in general, your interlocutor is likely to interpret your non-verbal \
manifestations as a sign of attack.  \\n\[Bullet] Use situations such as an \
opportunity to mutual benefit.  \\nDon't tell the developer to be quiet at \
meetings because he doesn't let anyone talk; ask him if he can help you get \
involved in other people's discussions.Explain that an introvert needs a \
longer break to start a conversation, and if he holds a five-second break \
before he pronounces the first words, it will help you a lot.  \\nIf you are \
focused on a common goal, view the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]problems\

something, manage your emotions, you will not only improve your efficiency, \
