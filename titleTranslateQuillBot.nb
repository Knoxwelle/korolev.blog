nI've been working on a bunch of programming projects.Each of them \
encountered problems that caused more trouble than the developer team \
expected.This often occurred as follows: some team members noticed such \
problems early, but most staff rejected or ignored all symptoms because they \
did not realize their importance until it was too late.\\n\\nThis happens for \
a variety of reasons:\\n\\n- Problems that seem trivial at an early stage of \
the project become critical when ix is too late to fix.The story of a welded \
frog is probably an exaggeration, but it perfectly illustrates what is \
happening in many projects.\\n\\n- Some employees often encounter resistance \
when other team members do not have similar experience or \
knowledge.Overcoming this resistance requires exceptional courage, confidence \
and persistence, and these qualities are rarely possessed even by highly paid \
experienced consultants hired specifically to prevent such problems.\\n\\n- \
Most developers are optimistic. Bitter life experiences teach us to moderate \
our optimism, but neophytes tend to look at the world optimistically. People \
who are naturally pessimistic are usually unpopular in teams, even if they \
are right over and over again.Few will want to risk their reputation and go \
against the majority without very serious grounds.Many of us are familiar \
with the feeling \\\"I don't like all this, but I can't explain why,\\\" but \
it rarely becomes an effective argument in a dispute.\\n\\n- Every member of \
the team has their own opinion about what is important and what is not.At the \
same time, their attention is focused on what they are personally responsible \
for, rather than the objectives of the project.\\n\\n- Each of us has our own \
\\\"blind spots\\\" - weaknesses and shortcomings that are difficult for us \
to realize or accept.\\n\\nHere are possible strategies to counter these \
factors:\\n\\n- Develop an organized approach to risk management. One of the \
easiest solutions is to monitor risks in the same way that you do with \
software errors. Anyone can identify a risk, and then every risk is monitored \
until it ceases to be a risk.When the risk status changes or new information \
appears, the risks are reviewed and re-ranked.This helps to remove \
unnecessary emotions from discussions and reminds us of the need for periodic \
risk reassessment.\\n\\n- Speaking against the majority, think about how to \
help the other members of the team understand you.In any team you are a \
member of, promote freedom of opinion and try to discuss controversial topics \
as quietly as possible.\\n\\n- Feelings like \\\"I don't like all this\\\" \
deserve attention.If there are no reliable facts yet, try to come up with the \
easiest way to verify that will provide them.\\n\\n- Constantly relate your \
vision of the system to the representations of the team and the \
customer.Tools such as a priority-rated list of informal requirements are \
useful, but do not replace regular customer communication and \
openness.\\n\\n- To see your \\\"blind spots\\\" is difficult by \
definition.The people from whom you are willing to hear the unpleasant truth \
when you need it are your precious resource.\"\>"}],

able to replace any member of his team and do anything from networking and \
configuring the assembly process to writing modular tests and performing \
performance tests. Without a good understanding of the entire range of \
technologies, an architect is little different from an ordinary project \
manager.Team members may have deeper knowledge in their narrow fields \[Dash] \
this is perfectly normal \[Dash] but they are unlikely to be able to trust \
their architect unless he is familiar with the technologies used.As has \
already been said, an architect is an interface between the technical team \
and the business, which means that he must understand all the technical \
aspects in order to play the role of the team representative before the \
business management, without constantly seeking help.For the same reasons, \
the architect must understand the business aspects of the organization in \
order to successfully lead the developers to the goal of satisfying the \
commercial interests of the company.\\n\\nThe work of an architect is similar \
to that of an airplane pilot: he may not look busy, but in reality uses \
decades of experience to keep an eye on the situation and intervene \
immediately in the event of an emergency.The project manager (second pilot) \
provides daily management, relieving the architect of routine and staff \
management.Ultimately, the architect must be responsible for the quality of \
the product and its timely delivery.These challenges are difficult to solve \
without personal authority, which plays an extremely important role in the \
success of any project.\\n\\nThe best way to learn is to observe others; \
that's how we learn in childhood.A good architect should be able to identify \
a problem, put together a team and, without looking for the culprits, explain \
the essence of the problem, and then propose an elegant solution or a way \
around.At the same time, the architect can ask the team for help without \
losing any authority.Developers should feel their contribution to the \
problem, but the architect guides the discussion and determines the right \
approach.\\n\\nArchitects should join the team at the very earliest stages of \
the project; they should not sit in an ivory tower, pointing the way forward \
from there, but work \\\"in the field\\\" with everyone else.The issues of \
choosing a strategic direction or technology should not be transformed into \
independent research or new projects \[Dash] they should be approached \
pragmatically, searching for answers in the course of practical work or \
seeking advice from colleagues-architects (all good architects know each \
other).\\n\\nA good architect must have at the expert level at least one of \
the tools of his profession, such as an integrated design environment (IDE); \
remember that the architect should be a practitioner.It is logical that the \
software architect should know the IDE, the database architect \[Dash] the \
toolkit for building substance-relation charts (ER-charts), and the \
information architect - the XML modeling tools.However, the lead architect \
must be able to apply tools at all levels, from monitoring network traffic \
using Wireshark to simulating complex financial messages in XMLSpy \[Dash] \
there are no levels too low or too high for him.\\n\\nAs a rule, an architect \
comes up with a good summary and an impressive past.This is usually easy to \
impress the management and technical staff, but without demonstrating his \

key to success.  \\n\\nObjectively measure the degree of influence of the \

standing up will help to establish visual contact with the entire audience. \
Optical contact, gestures, mimics and other visual elements play an important \
role in communication. In addition, the standing position changes the tone \

that you are heard in a large room, making pauses to highlight important \
